Design an algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. Requirements:
1. Implement in Python with type hints
2. Handle disconnected graphs
3. Return both path and total distance
4. Time complexity: O((V+E) log V)
5. Include test cases

Provide production-ready, well-documented code.
