Explain the race condition in this multi-threaded code and provide a fix:

```python
counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        counter += 1

threads = [Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(10)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(counter)  # Expected: 1000000, Actual: varies
```

Explain why the result is inconsistent and provide thread-safe solution.
