The tokens are updating for that request because in the new window there are 6.2k consistently changing but in the status line the tokens are never getting updated. I think it is still not working there is something is not right that it is not connected it looks like. And I observe another scenario is whenever the numbers are displaying the confidence score or the status of the agents like they are displaying it but when the request completes everything is becoming blank but I want to keep hold of that values when the request completes until I enter a new prompt. Whatever the last status that it was there active with all the details that it was displaying when the request completes let that be displaying there so that it will be available even after the request completes I can see that status when I am entering the next prompt. So what you have to do is whatever the last status before it is completing it is displaying for all agents tokens confidence in status let it be there whatever the last active status that was displaying the full results. Once I enter new prompt and enter then it can again refresh for every three second 300 microsecond that should be fine. Do not break any existing working functionality only enhance the functionality to make new changes by that way we do not have to rewrite the code again for the broken changes.

If you look at the agents right now in the status line it is showing 114 I'm just trying to understand how can I view the is there a command or something that I can enter and see what each agent is doing or I can view them what are their actions what are they trying to do it is it still working or is it completed and still they are not cleared I like is there a fair and approach that we have to run a separate process to clear up the agents I am just trying to understand why are they keep increasing they are never getting going down you see what I mean because I still am executing only in wall or two windows but those agents are keep increasing from past 5 instances so I have a doubt on that can you check on that one and how can we fix that issue. So you are telling mostly about the per instance details that you are trying to display in the new changes right So in the per instance changes you are going to display that the current active question that is executed that is what you are displaying right because the past question when it completes its display its agents are cleared right unless there is some background task is running You got what I mean or is there any context or anything that we are missing here. And looking at the other metrics also even confidence how you are calculating status how we are displaying tokens is still not working there is no doubt in it I don't know what is happening let me see now I am going to write a new instance and let you know all these are on the current instance right and they are getting updated currently for every 300 microseconds Based on the current question that is executing and running or if there is any background task that is running also include because both of them take token aside because based on this instance they are utilizing per instance tokens and the percentage calculation accordingly right Do not break any existing working functionality only enhance the functionality to make new changes by that way we do not have to rewrite the code again for the broken changes",
