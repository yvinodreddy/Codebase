The tokens are updating for that request because in the new window there are 6.2k consistently changing but in the status line the tokens are never getting updated. I think it is still not working there is something is not right that it is not connected it looks like. And I observe another scenario is whenever the numbers are displaying the confidence score or the status of the agents like they are displaying it but when the request completes everything is becoming blank but I want to keep hold of that values when the request completes until I enter a new prompt. Whatever the last status that it was there active with all the details that it was displaying when the request completes let that be displaying there so that it will be available even after the request completes I can see that status when I am entering the next prompt. So what you have to do is whatever the last status before it is completing it is displaying for all agents tokens confidence in status let it be there whatever the last active status that was displaying the full results. Once I enter new prompt and enter then it can again refresh for every three second 300 microsecond that should be fine. Do not break any existing working functionality only enhance the functionality to make new changes by that way we do not have to rewrite the code again for the broken changes.

    "prompt": "context was low so we are running command again you can continue\n\nI was looking at your document why can't we use a fully database approach because if system crashes then we are going to lose the data right we are going to lose the context all right because always there should be a stable way of loading the context even when I am trying to load between the multiple instances right And then when I'm trying to load from the let us say I design a Project level let's say I created a project and I created an id for that project and all the context for that project is stored in the back end means let's say if I am opening from 10 different instances or if I am working on a single instance for longer period of times right so if I am trying to implement something like Where I should have a full visibility and full control across the multiple instances by loading the full cache By that way every time we load the full context data into the front end or I would say the cache means either way whichever is the way that you call it as better what happens is let us take an example if we are building a bigger projects if I run single instance for millions of tokens keep running all the time so it is better we keep the whole context in the back end And load that into the cash Asynchronously so that it won't impact anything over on the primary processes right Then execute once I think and await loads all the data then you execute the tokens that is given by the cloud for 200K Then run for second request Let it be smaller request or a bigger request it does not do any problematic situation right because even if it is bigger request we are using almost 150K token or if it is 200K token what happens everything will be stored in the back end and then it makes it to zero context tokens and then again it picks up from wherever it is leftover So it is a never ending situation where there is no way that our context is lost not even a .0 .0001% also because one 100% context is retrieved all the time Now the tokens we can clear it manually and we can utilize it Now this is one instance let's say I have a bigger project same project i'm opening for 3 or 4 excessive instances now I have multiple phases let's say I have 10 phases running on it I have 10 instances opened each instance need a full context retrieval Then this DV approach all the instances will have a full context available all the instances parallely can be executed with 100 percent success rate and all the instances are not dependent on the context itself because of the context is already there getting it from the back end so this way of implementation it will help for single instance for longer period of times Or large outputs or multiple instances to carry out full context management and full larger inputs on all multiple instances with 100 percent success rate you see what I mean that way it is going to be very efficient and you said about if you are storing db we are going to take a lot of time No right if you are using a synchronous approach and load the data and keep it in cache right then you have everything in the cache even for the first time right after first time you have everything in the cache in the front end in that instance and then whatever new things comes up keep adding to the cache by that way it will be having fully context available there So even if I open 100 instances no difference it always maintains tokens at full level and full context level and result will be 100% success rate so that there will not be any issue even for the larger projects because I have a project for 1300 story points if I want to run it or execute into multiple instances I need something like this architecture So that even if I run it on multiple instances even for the longer periods of time even it is further bigger context management we are not going to lose any context and we are going to maintain tokens all the time 200K And we are going to generate the result all the time 100 percent success rate you see what I mean that way our implementation is going to be a world class right can you prepare an implementation plan and do a thorough in depth analysis in a comprehensive manner with a step by step approach and let me know how this approach goes so that once I understand the whole picture Then we can implement it so that we will not have this context problem itself altogether You got what I mean\n\nYou can add to the analysis let's say I have five projects each of them are running on the 33 instances total 15 instances are running so if we maintain the context based on project id and all the context that it is coming from the db so that we do not have any problem right So because every window that we loaded for that context that has full context available and tokens we can make it clear it up and we can get a result 100% success rate right that way we can manage multiple projects with a full context with full tokens and a success rate of 100 percent\n\nDo not break any existing working functionality only enhance the functionality to make new changes by that way we do not have to rewrite the code again for
