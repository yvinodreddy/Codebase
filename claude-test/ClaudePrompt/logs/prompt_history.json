The tokens are updating for that request because in the new window there are 6.2k consistently changing but in the status line the tokens are never getting updated. I think it is still not working there is something is not right that it is not connected it looks like. And I observe another scenario is whenever the numbers are displaying the confidence score or the status of the agents like they are displaying it but when the request completes everything is becoming blank but I want to keep hold of that values when the request completes until I enter a new prompt. Whatever the last status that it was there active with all the details that it was displaying when the request completes let that be displaying there so that it will be available even after the request completes I can see that status when I am entering the next prompt. So what you have to do is whatever the last status before it is completing it is displaying for all agents tokens confidence in status let it be there whatever the last active status that was displaying the full results. Once I enter new prompt and enter then it can again refresh for every three second 300 microsecond that should be fine. Do not break any existing working functionality only enhance the functionality to make new changes by that way we do not have to rewrite the code again for the broken changes.
