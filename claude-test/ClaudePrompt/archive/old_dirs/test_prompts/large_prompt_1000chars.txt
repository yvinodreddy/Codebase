This is a comprehensive test prompt to verify that ultrathinkc can handle prompts of substantial length without any issues. The system should process this through all guardrails layers, verification systems, and context management components. This is simulating a real-world scenario where a developer needs to provide detailed requirements for a complex feature implementation.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
We are building a distributed microservices architecture for a healthcare application that needs to handle patient records, appointment scheduling, billing integration, and real-time notifications. The system must comply with HIPAA regulations and achieve 99.9% uptime.
