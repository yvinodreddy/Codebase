- How to use it
- Why it's valuable
- Real performance metrics

### Path 2: Comprehensive (2-3 hours)
**For: I want to master it completely**

1. Read: `QUICKSTART_LEARNING.md` (10 min)
2. Read: `ULTRATHINKC_COMPLETE_LEARNING_GUIDE.md` (60-90 min)
3. Run: `./run_complete_tests.sh` (15 min)
4. Run: `./compare_with_without.sh` (15 min)
5. Practice: Examples from the guide (30-60 min)

**You'll master:**
- Internal architecture
- All components and guardrails
- Token optimization
- Troubleshooting
- Advanced usage

### Path 3: Just Show Me (10 minutes)
**For: I want to see it in action first**

```bash
# 1. See the flow
./cpp --how

# 2. Try simple example
./cpp "Write a Python function to reverse a string"

# 3. Try complex example with details
./cpp "Design a REST API for user management" --verbose

# 4. See comparison
./compare_with_without.sh
```

Then decide if you want to dive deeper!
