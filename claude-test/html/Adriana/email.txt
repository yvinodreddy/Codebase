Hi Adriana,

Thank you for the important question. Yes, Rajesh Kumar Gupta's H-1B visa is sponsored by Paragroup LLC. We are his official employer and H-1B sponsor.

Given this, I understand from your email that he might qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits if our employer-sponsored coverage is "unaffordable" (exceeds 9.12% of his household income).

AFFORDABILITY CALCULATION:
Rajesh's household income: $132,000/year
9.12% affordability threshold: $12,038/year = $1,003/month

Based on preliminary research, small group insurance would likely cost Rajesh approximately $2,160/month (90% of ~$2,400 total premium), which is well above the $1,003/month affordability threshold.

This would make employer-sponsored coverage "unaffordable" and qualify Rajesh for Marketplace premium tax credits.

REVISED REQUEST:
Given this information, please provide quotes for:

OPTION 1: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE WITH SUBSIDIES
- If employer coverage is unaffordable (employee cost > $1,003/month)
- Rajesh would qualify for premium tax credits
- Please show subsidized pricing for:
  - UnitedHealthcare plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
  - AmeriHealth plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
  - Silver tier EPO plans

OPTION 2: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE WITHOUT SUBSIDIES
- Full price for comparison
- Same carriers and plan types

OPTION 3: SMALL GROUP / SHOP INSURANCE
- Through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- Total premium and 10% employer / 90% employee split
- UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth EPO plans

EMPLOYEE & FAMILY:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, H-1B (Paragroup sponsored)
Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, H-4 dependent
Child 1: Hridhaan Gupta, DOB 04/16/2016, H-4 dependent
Child 2: Kevit Gupta, DOB 07/03/2024, US citizen
Income: $132,000/year
ZIP: 07920 (Basking Ridge, NJ)

QUESTION: Can you confirm whether small group coverage would be "unaffordable" under the ACA definition, thus making Rajesh eligible for Marketplace subsidies?

I'm available for our scheduled call Friday at 3:15 PM.

Thank you,

Vinod,
According to your legal status: Is the H-1B visa you currently hold sponsored by  that/your small company?

In general, you should obtain coverage through private health insurance. H-1B employees may qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits only if employer-sponsored coverage is unaffordable. H-4 spouses and children generally cannot receive premium tax credits, though they can still purchase coverage on the Marketplace at full price.



See my comments in your previous emails 



I hope that helps,



Adriana

Hi Adriana,

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate your help with this.

I would like to request quotes for BOTH options so I can compare which approach is more cost-effective:

OPTION 1: SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE (through Paragroup LLC)
OPTION 2: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE INSURANCE (for comparison)

Here is the complete information:

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT VISA STATUS & ACA:

- The employee (H-1B) and spouse/child on H-4 visas CANNOT receive premium tax credits or subsidies on the marketplace
- However, they CAN purchase marketplace insurance at full price
- The US citizen child (Kevit) may be eligible for CHIP or subsidies
- Employee's estimated 2024 household income: $132,000

WHAT I'RE REQUESTING:

OPTION 1 - SMALL GROUP INSURANCE:
- Quote through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- Group coverage for employee + family (4 people)
- PPO or EPO plans from Horizon BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, AmeriHealth
- Show 10% employer contribution / 90% employee contribution
- Coverage effective: November 1, 2025

OPTION 2 - INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE INSURANCE:
- Individual/family plan through GetCoveredNJ marketplace

- Coverage effective: November 1, 2025

WHY I'M REQUESTING BOTH:

I want to compare:
1. Group insurance with 10% employer contribution
2. Individual insurance (possibly with ICHRA reimbursement arrangement) YOUR ACCOUNTING SHOULD DO THIS and evaluate your case

This will help me determine which approach is more cost-effective for both the business and the employee.
