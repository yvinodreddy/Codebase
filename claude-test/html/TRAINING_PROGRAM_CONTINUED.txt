LESSON 5.1: Modifying Your Skill (20 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE: Customize the skill for new requirements

SCENARIO: Your company expands to California. You need to add CA-specific rules.


EXERCISE 5.1A: Add California Support
--------------------------------------

Step 1: Open SKILL.md for editing

Step 2: Find "State-Specific Rules" section (or create it)
  Add after "Special Considerations" section:

  ### State-Specific Rules

  **New Jersey:**
  - Minimum employer contribution: 10%
  - Small group definition: 2-50 employees
  - ACA affordability: 9.12% of household income (2025)

  **California:**
  - Minimum employer contribution: 50% (stricter than NJ!)
  - Small group definition: 1-100 employees
  - Additional requirement: Offer coverage to full-time employees (30+ hrs/week)
  - Covered California marketplace subsidy rules

Step 3: Update Calculation Methods
  Add:

  ### California Affordability Calculation:
  ```
  CA Minimum Contribution = Total Premium × 50%
  If Employer Contributes < 50% → Not compliant
  ```

Step 4: Save as new version
  □ Update version in YAML: version: 1.1.0
  □ Save file
  □ Re-package as ZIP
  □ Upload to Claude (replaces old version)

Step 5: Test CA Rules
  New conversation:
  "I have a California employee. What's my minimum contribution?"

  Claude should respond: "50% of total premium (California requirement)"


✋ YOUR TURN: Add Another State
-------------------------------
Pick a state where you might hire: _______________

Research:
□ Minimum employer contribution requirement: _______%
□ Small group definition: ____-____ employees
□ Any unique rules: _______________________________________

Add this to SKILL.md following the CA example pattern.

                           cleaning_copay=0, filling_cost=100):
      annual_premium = dental_premium * 12
      cleaning_costs = cleanings_per_year * cleaning_copay
      estimated_fillings = filling_cost  # Assume 1 filling per year
      return annual_premium + cleaning_costs + estimated_fillings

Step 5: Test
  python3 cost_calculator.py
  # Add test at end of file:
  dental_cost = amerihealth.calculate_dental_cost(
      dental_premium=45,
      cleanings_per_year=2,
      cleaning_copay=25
  )
  print(f"Annual Dental Cost: ${dental_cost}")


ENHANCEMENT 2: Add Timeline Tracking

    def days_until_coverage(self):
        today = datetime.now()
        delta = self.start_date - today
        return delta.days

    def enrollment_deadline(self, days_before=14):
        return self.start_date - timedelta(days=days_before)

    def get_milestones(self):
        today = datetime.now()
        deadline = self.enrollment_deadline()
        days_remaining = self.days_until_coverage()

        return {
            "today": today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            "enrollment_deadline": deadline.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            "coverage_starts": self.start_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            "days_remaining": days_remaining,
            "status": "URGENT" if days_remaining < 7 else
                     "SOON" if days_remaining < 14 else "ON_TRACK"
        }

Step 2: Update SKILL.md
  Add to "Key Capabilities":
    7. Timeline Management
       - Calculate days until coverage starts
       - Identify enrollment deadlines
       - Flag urgent timelines

Step 3: Test
  python3
  >>> from timeline_tracker import InsuranceTimeline
  >>> timeline = InsuranceTimeline("2025-11-01")

OBJECTIVE: Apply everything you learned to build a completely new skill

PROJECT: Create a "Vendor Comparison" skill
--------------------------------------------

Step 1: Define the Use Case
  WHO: Small business owners evaluating vendors (software, services, suppliers)
  WHAT: Compare multiple vendor quotes, calculate TCO, make recommendations
  WHY: Similar process to insurance (multiple quotes, cost comparison)


Step 2: Create Folder Structure
  mkdir vendor-comparison-skill
  cd vendor-comparison-skill
  touch SKILL.md README.md
  mkdir scripts templates


Step 3: Write SKILL.md
  Start with YAML:
  ---
  name: vendor-comparison
  description: Compares vendor quotes, calculates total cost of ownership (TCO),
               analyzes contract terms, and generates comparison reports for
               procurement decisions
  version: 1.0.0
  author: [Your Name]
  ---

  Then add sections (following insurance skill as template):
  □ Purpose
  □ When to Use This Skill
  □ Key Capabilities (data extraction, TCO calculation, contract analysis)
  □ Input Format (vendor quotes, contract terms, requirements)
  □ Output Format (comparison table, TCO analysis, recommendation)
  □ Calculation Methods (TCO = Purchase + Implementation + Annual Fees × Years)
  □ Example Usage
  □ Best Practices


Step 4: Create Calculator Script
  scripts/tco_calculator.py

  class VendorTCOCalculator:
      def __init__(self, purchase_cost, implementation_cost,
                   annual_fee, contract_years):
          self.purchase_cost = purchase_cost
          self.implementation_cost = implementation_cost
          self.annual_fee = annual_fee
          self.contract_years = contract_years

      def calculate_tco(self):
          annual_costs = self.annual_fee * self.contract_years
          total = (self.purchase_cost +
                   self.implementation_cost +
                   annual_costs)
          return total

      def calculate_monthly_average(self):
          tco = self.calculate_tco()
          return tco / (self.contract_years * 12)


Step 5: Create Template
  templates/vendor_comparison_template.txt

  ============================================================
  VENDOR COMPARISON ANALYSIS
  [Company Name] - [Date]
  ============================================================

================================================================================
ANSWER KEY - FINAL MASTERY TEST
================================================================================

SECTION A ANSWERS:
------------------
1. YAML frontmatter provides metadata (name, description, version) that Claude
   uses to identify and understand the skill before loading full content.

2. The description field determines WHEN Claude activates the skill. It must
   contain relevant keywords and clearly describe capabilities.

3. Progressive disclosure means Claude only loads the full skill content (8KB)
   when it's relevant, not all the time. This keeps conversations token-efficient.

4. ~50 tokens (just the YAML metadata). Full skill is ~2000 tokens when loaded.

5. SKILL.md = Instructions FOR Claude (technical, how to execute)
   README.md = Instructions FOR humans (user guide, installation, examples)

6. The skill has clear input/output interfaces, so it can work with other skills
   (xlsx for Excel export, pdf for data extraction, etc.)

7. Skills use standard file format (SKILL.md, scripts, templates) that works
   identically in web app, CLI, and API. No platform-specific modifications.

8. Claude matches user queries to skill descriptions. Keywords like "insurance",
   "compare", "costs" trigger the insurance-plan-analyzer skill.

9. ROI = (Annual Savings - Creation Cost) / Creation Cost × 100%
   Or: (Hours Saved × Rate × Uses per Year - Creation Hours × Rate) / (Creation Hours × Rate)

10. Sandboxed execution prevents unauthorized file access, network calls, or
    system modifications. Keeps your data secure and private.


SECTION B ANSWERS:
------------------
Task 1 Example:
def calculate_hsa_contribution(self, family_status="individual"):
    limits = {
        "individual": 4300,
        "family": 8550
    }
    return limits.get(family_status, 0)

Task 2 Sections to Add:
1. COBRA Coverage Comparison (Key Capabilities)
2. COBRA Cost Calculation Method (Formula: Current Premium × 102%)
3. COBRA Timeline Rules (18-36 months, 60-day election period)

Task 3 Contract Review Keywords:
1. "contract" + "review"
2. "contract" + "analyze"
3. "agreement" + "terms"
4. "NDA" + "review"
5. "vendor contract" + "risks"

Task 4 ROI Calculation:
Annual savings: 2 hrs × 8 uses × $75 = $1,200
Creation cost: 3 hrs × $75 = $225
First year ROI: ($1,200 - $225) / $225 = 433%
Payback period: $225 / ($150 per use) = 1.5 uses (~2 months)

Task 5 Debug Checklist:
1. Check skill is enabled (toggle ON in Settings)
2. Verify YAML description has relevant keywords
3. Use explicit trigger words in query
4. Check Claude plan level (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise)
5. Try manually invoking: "Use the [skill-name] skill"


SECTION C ANSWERS:
------------------
1. ACA Affordability:
   Threshold = $95,000 × 9.12% = $8,664/year = $722/month
   Employee pays (90% of $1,950) = $1,755/month
   $1,755 > $722 → UNAFFORDABLE

2. Annual costs:
   Small group: ($195 employer + $1,755 employee) × 12 = $23,400
   Individual no subsidy: ($0 employer + $1,450 employee) × 12 = $17,400
   Individual with subsidy: ($0 employer + $700 employee) × 12 = $8,400

3. Individual with subsidy saves the most:
   $23,400 - $8,400 = $15,000/year savings

4. Recommendation:
   "Choose individual marketplace with subsidy ($700/month). Since the small
   group plan is unaffordable under ACA rules ($1,755 > $722 threshold) and
   Sarah is a US citizen, she qualifies for the $750/month subsidy. This saves
   $15,000 annually compared to small group insurance."

5. Texas-specific rules to add:
   - Texas does not require employer contribution (unlike NJ's 10% minimum)
   - Small group definition: 2-50 employees
   - Texas marketplace: HealthCare.gov (not state exchange)
