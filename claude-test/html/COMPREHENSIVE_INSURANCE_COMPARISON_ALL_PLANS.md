## WHAT TO TELL RAJESH

**Simple Script:**

"Rajesh, I analyzed all 8 marketplace insurance plans available to you. Here's what I found:

**The small group business plan costs you $1,848/month. I found plans for as low as $564/month.**

**I recommend 3 options:**

**OPTION 1 (BEST VALUE): AmeriHealth IHC Silver - $720/month**
- You save $1,128 per month ($13,536/year)
- FREE lab work for kids
- $25 to see your doctor (no deductible)
- Dr. Mary Lare is in-network
- Better coverage than Bronze plans for only $155/month more

**OPTION 2 (CHEAPEST): Oscar Bronze - $565/month**
- You save $1,283 per month ($15,396/year)
- Higher deductible ($3,000) but good if we're healthy
- Dr. Mary Lare is in-network
- Saves extra $155/month vs Silver

**OPTION 3 (BEST PROTECTION): Aetna Silver - $752/month**
- You save $1,096 per month ($13,152/year)
- Best protection if you have high medical costs
- Lowest maximum out-of-pocket
- Dr. Mary Lare is in-network

**My recommendation: AmeriHealth Silver at $720/month. With two young kids (ages 1 and 9), you'll likely have frequent doctor visits and need lab work. This plan gives you the best value - free labs, no deductible for doctor visits, and lower costs when you're sick.**

## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why is marketplace insurance so much cheaper than small group?**
A: Because Rajesh qualifies for an $866/month government subsidy. Without subsidy, the cheapest plan would be $1,431/month (Oscar Bronze before subsidy).

**Q: Is Dr. Mary Lare really in-network for all plans?**
A: YES. The third PDF confirms she is in-network for UHC Silver Advantage, UHC Bronze Value, AND AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO. All marketplace plans show her as in-network.

**Q: What if we need a doctor not in network?**
A: These are all EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) plans. Out-of-network care is NOT covered except for emergencies. You must use in-network providers.

**Q: Can we switch plans mid-year if we don't like it?**
A: Generally no, unless you have a qualifying life event (birth, marriage, loss of coverage, etc.). Open enrollment is once per year.

**Q: What happens if we hit the out-of-pocket maximum?**
A: The insurance company pays 100% of all covered services for the rest of the year.

**Q: Is the $866 subsidy guaranteed?**
A: Yes, as long as:
1. Paragroup sponsors Rajesh's H-1B (YES - confirmed)
2. Group insurance costs more than 9.12% of income (YES - $1,848 > $1,003)
3. Rajesh's income stays around $132K

**Q: What if Rajesh's income changes?**
A: Report it immediately to the marketplace. Subsidy will be adjusted up or down.

**Q: Do we need to verify anything with Adriana on Friday?**
A: Yes, confirm the $866 subsidy is correct and start enrollment process to meet Oct 24 deadline.
