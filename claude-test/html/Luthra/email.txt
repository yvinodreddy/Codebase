Hello Jolly,

Thank you for sending the plan comparisons and for verifying that Dr. Mary Lare accepts UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth.

I need to clarify an important detail about the pricing: My employee is on an H-1B visa and CANNOT receive premium tax credits or subsidies on the marketplace. His spouse is H-4 dependent and one child is also H-4. Only one child is a US citizen.

CLARIFICATION NEEDED:

The quotes you sent show prices "after $866.00 savings" which suggests a monthly subsidy of $866. Since my H-1B employee cannot receive subsidies, I need to confirm the ACTUAL prices:

BRONZE PLANS - What is the real price WITHOUT subsidies?
- Oscar Bronze Classic: Shows $564.65/month → Actual price $1,430.65/month?
- Horizon OMNIA Bronze: Shows $637.98/month → Actual price $1,503.98/month?
- UHC Bronze Value: Shows $695.44/month → Actual price $1,561.44/month?

SILVER PLANS - What is the real price WITHOUT subsidies?
- Aetna Silver 2 Advanced: Shows $751.58/month → Actual price $1,617.58/month?
- Oscar Silver Classic: Shows $836.30/month → Actual price $1,702.30/month?
- AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO: Shows $719.92/month → Actual price $1,585.92/month?
- UHC Silver Advantage: Shows $961.85/month → Actual price $1,827.85/month?

Can you please confirm these actual prices are correct for an H-1B visa holder with no subsidies?

ALSO REQUESTING: SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE QUOTES

I would also like to compare individual marketplace insurance with small group business insurance through my company to see which is more cost-effective.

Can you provide quotes for BOTH options:

OPTION 1: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE (No Subsidies for H-1B)
- UnitedHealthcare plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
- AmeriHealth plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
- Full price without any subsidies
- Family of 4: Employee (age 44, H-1B), Spouse (age 32, H-4), Children (ages 9 H-4, and 1 US citizen)

OPTION 2: SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE
- Quote through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth EPO/PPO plans
- Same family of 4
- Show total premium with 10% employer / 90% employee split

EMPLOYEE DETAILS:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, H-1B visa, non-tobacco
Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, H-4 visa, non-tobacco
Child 1: Hridhaan Gupta, DOB 04/16/2016, H-4 visa
Child 2: Kevit Gupta, DOB 07/03/2024, US citizen (born in USA)
Annual household income: $132,000
Home ZIP: 07920 (Basking Ridge, NJ)
Coverage effective: November 1, 2025

IMPORTANT: Since the employee is H-1B visa, he is NOT eligible for premium tax credits or subsidies. Please provide quotes showing the full premium cost without any subsidies.

WHY I'M REQUESTING BOTH:
I want to compare which option is more cost-effective:
1. Individual marketplace insurance at full price (no subsidies)
2. Small group business insurance with 10% employer contribution

Based on the prices in your initial email, individual marketplace insurance WITHOUT subsidies might actually be less expensive than small group insurance, which is why I want to compare both options.

If you handle both types of insurance, please provide quotes for both. If you specialize in only individual or only small group, please let me know which you can assist with.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
