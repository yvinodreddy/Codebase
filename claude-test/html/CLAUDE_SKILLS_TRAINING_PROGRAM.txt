LESSON 1.1: What Is a Claude Skill? (10 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCEPT: The Restaurant Analogy
--------------------------------
Imagine you go to a restaurant:

WITHOUT A SKILL (Every time you order):
  You: "I'd like a burger, but not too much lettuce, add extra pickles,
       medium-well, on a sesame bun, with fries on the side..."
  Server: "Got it. Anything else?"
  You: "Yes, also make sure the fries are crispy, not too salty..."

  [You explain EVERYTHING in detail EVERY time]

WITH A SKILL (Your saved "usual" order):
  You: "I'll have my usual."
  Server: [Looks at your profile] "Got it - the burger with extra pickles,
          medium-well, fries crispy and lightly salted. Coming right up!"

  [Server knows your preferences, applies them automatically]

A Claude Skill is YOUR "USUAL ORDER" for repetitive tasks.


REAL EXAMPLE: Your Insurance Analysis
---------------------------------------
WITHOUT the insurance-plan-analyzer skill:
  Every time you need to analyze insurance quotes, you must:
  1. Tell Claude to extract data from emails
  2. Explain how to calculate costs (monthly, annual, with tax)
  3. Describe the 9.12% affordability rule for H-1B
  4. Explain ICHRA reimbursement structure
  5. Specify output format (Notepad++ compatible tables)
  6. Provide formulas for each calculation
  7. Explain comparison methodology
  [This takes 5-10 minutes of explanation EVERY time]

WITH the insurance-plan-analyzer skill:
  You: "Compare these insurance quotes"
  Claude: [Automatically loads skill] [Knows all formulas, rules, formats]
        [Produces complete analysis immediately]
  [Zero explanation needed - Claude remembers everything]

LESSON 1.2: How Skills Work Technically (10 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE 4-STAGE PROCESS:
--------------------

STAGE 1: METADATA SCANNING (Constant, Lightweight)
  What happens: Claude reads the YAML "business card" from each skill

  Example from YOUR skill:
    ---
    name: insurance-plan-analyzer
    description: Analyzes and compares health insurance plans (individual
                 vs group), calculates costs, verifies networks, and
                 generates formatted comparison reports for decision-making
    ---

  Token cost: ~50 tokens (very cheap!)
  When: Every conversation, all skills scanned
  Think of it as: Claude glancing at business cards in your wallet


STAGE 2: RELEVANCE DETECTION (Automatic, Smart)
  What happens: Claude matches your query to skill descriptions

  Example:
    You say: "Compare these insurance quotes"
    Claude thinks: [Scans descriptions...]
                   [Finds: "Analyzes and compares health insurance plans"]
                   [Match! This skill is relevant]

  Keywords that trigger YOUR skill:
    ✓ "insurance" + "compare"
    ✓ "insurance" + "costs"
    ✓ "individual vs group insurance"
    ✓ "H-1B" + "subsidies"
    ✓ "ICHRA"

  Think of it as: Claude picking the right business card for the job


STAGE 3: PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE (Efficient, On-Demand)
  What happens: Claude loads FULL skill content (only when needed)

  Example:
    [Skill matched] → Claude loads SKILL.md (8.3KB, ~2000 tokens)
    [Reads all instructions, formulas, examples]
    [Now knows exactly how to process insurance quotes]

  Token cost: ~2000 tokens (only when skill is used)
  Think of it as: Claude reading the full instruction manual


STAGE 4: EXECUTION (Sandboxed, Secure)
  What happens: Claude follows skill instructions, uses scripts/templates

  Example:
    [Loads cost_calculator.py]
    [Runs calculations with your data]
    [Uses comparison_report_template.txt for formatting]
    [Produces final report]

  Security: Runs in isolated environment, no external access
  Think of it as: Chef preparing your order in the kitchen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR BEFORE & AFTER STORY:
--------------------------

BEFORE (October 16-17, 2025):
  Task: Compare insurance options for Rajesh

  What you did:
  ⏱️  Hour 1: Contacted 20+ insurance agents, waited for responses
  ⏱️  Hour 2: Received emails from Chuck, Jolly, Adriana - read each carefully
  ⏱️  Hour 3: Manually extracted quotes into notes
      - AmeriHealth Silver EPO: $2,053/month (Chuck)
      - Same plan individual: $1,586/month (Jolly)
      - Subsidy amount: $866/month (Jolly)
  ⏱️  Hour 4: Calculated costs in spreadsheet
      - 10% employer contribution = ?
      - 90% employee cost = ?
      - Annual totals = ?
      - Tax savings = ?
  ⏱️  Hour 5: Researched H-1B subsidy rules
      - Found 9.12% affordability threshold
      - Calculated $132k × 9.12% = $1,003/month
      - Determined Rajesh qualifies for subsidies
  ⏱️  Hour 6: Formatted report in text file
      - Created tables, aligned columns
      - Fixed formatting issues multiple times
      - Generated final 82KB document

  TOTAL TIME: 6 hours
  STRESS LEVEL: High (worried about calculation errors)
  REUSABILITY: Zero (must repeat for next employee)


AFTER (With insurance-plan-analyzer skill):
  Task: Compare insurance options for [next employee]

  What you'll do:
  ⏱️  Minute 1-5: Forward emails to Claude
  ⏱️  Minute 6-10: Claude extracts all data automatically
  ⏱️  Minute 11-15: All calculations done (monthly, annual, tax, subsidies)
  ⏱️  Minute 16-20: Formatted report generated, ready to send

  TOTAL TIME: 20 minutes
  STRESS LEVEL: Low (calculations verified and consistent)
  REUSABILITY: Infinite (works for every future analysis)

  TIME SAVED: 5 hours 40 minutes (94% reduction)
  VALUE SAVED: 5.67 hours × $75/hour = $425 per use

✅ MODULE 1 COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
---------------------------------
Before proceeding to Module 2, verify:
□ I understand what a Claude Skill is (the "usual order" concept)
□ I understand the 4 stages of skill activation
□ I understand why skills save time (no re-explaining)
□ I completed all 3 comprehension checks
□ I see the value for MY specific work

If all checked, proceed to Module 2!


📖 ANSWERS TO COMPREHENSION CHECKS:
------------------------------------

Check 1.1 Answers:
Q1: A Claude Skill is a reusable instruction package that teaches Claude
    how to perform a specific task automatically, without needing to
    re-explain the process each time.

Q2: Skills save time by eliminating the need to re-explain instructions,
    formulas, and formatting every time you do the same task.

Q3: The insurance-plan-analyzer skill knows all the calculation formulas
    (9.12% rule, tax savings, ICHRA), output formatting, and analysis
    methodology, so I just provide the data and it does everything else.


Check 1.2 Answers:
Q1: Four stages:
    1. Metadata Scanning (reading YAML frontmatter)
    2. Relevance Detection (matching query to description)
    3. Progressive Disclosure (loading full skill content)
    4. Execution (following instructions, running scripts)

Q2: Metadata scanning is cheap because it only reads the YAML frontmatter
    (name, description, version) which is ~50 tokens, not the full 8KB file.

Q3: Claude loads the full skill content (Stage 3) only when it determines
    the skill is relevant to your query during Stage 2 (relevance detection).


Check 1.3 Answers:
Q1: The skill saves approximately 5 hours 40 minutes per analysis
    (from 6 hours manual to 20 minutes automated = 94% reduction).

Q2: At 4 uses per year, the annual value saved is approximately $1,700
    (or $1,050 if using the conservative 3.5-4.5 hour savings estimate).

Q3: Two benefits beyond time savings:
    1. Knowledge preservation (expertise encoded, doesn't leave with you)
    2. Consistent quality (every analysis follows best practices)
    [Also acceptable: Training efficiency, Scalability, Confidence]
