================================================================================
ROI CALCULATION
================================================================================

ONE-TIME COSTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skill creation time:       2 hours (already done!)
Your hourly value:         $75 (based on $132k salary ÷ 1,760 hours)
One-time investment:       $150


RECURRING BENEFITS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage frequency:           4 times per year
  (Annual renewal, new hire, mid-year change, policy review)

Per-use savings:
  Manual time:             4-5 hours
  With skill:              0.25-0.5 hours
  Time saved:              3.5-4.5 hours per use
  Value saved:             $262-338 per use

Annual savings:
  Total time saved:        14-18 hours per year
  Total value saved:       $1,050-1,350 per year


ROI:
  First year ROI:          ($1,050 - $150) / $150 = 600% ROI
  Subsequent years:        $1,050 / $0 = Infinite ROI
  Payback period:          After 1st use (~2 months)


CUMULATIVE 3-YEAR VALUE:
  Year 1:  $1,050 - $150 = $900 net value
  Year 2:  $1,050
  Year 3:  $1,050
  Total:   $3,000 net value over 3 years


================================================================================
IF YOU DON'T HAVE PRO/MAX/TEAM/ENTERPRISE PLAN
================================================================================

You can still use the skill components manually:

OPTION 1: Use the Calculator Script
python3 scripts/cost_calculator.py
- Modify with your specific quote data
- Get automated calculations
- Still faster than manual Excel work


OPTION 2: Use the Report Template
templates/comparison_report_template.txt
- Copy and fill in your data
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Faster than creating from scratch each time


OPTION 3: Reference the Skill as Documentation
SKILL.md serves as a documented process:
- Checklist of steps to follow
- Formulas and calculation methods
- Best practices and considerations
- Train team members on this process


OPTION 4: Upgrade Your Plan
Claude Pro: $20/month
  $20/month × 12 = $240/year
  ROI: $1,050 savings - $240 cost = $810 net benefit
  Still highly profitable!


================================================================================
