# Read the skill file
with open("insurance-plan-analyzer-skill/SKILL.md", "r") as f:
    skill_content = f.read()

# Create a custom skill (simplified approach)
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25"],
    system=skill_content,  # Include skill as system prompt
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Compare these insurance quotes: [your data]"
    }]
)
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Comparison
```
You: "I have 3 insurance quotes from different agents.
      Chuck quoted $2,053/month for AmeriHealth Silver EPO.
      Jolly quoted $1,586/month for the same plan on marketplace.
      Which is better?"

Claude: [Activates insurance-plan-analyzer skill]
        [Compares costs, calculates savings, generates report]

        Result: Individual marketplace saves $5,604/year
```

### Example 2: H-1B Subsidy Analysis
```
You: "My H-1B employee makes $132k. Can he get subsidies if
      group insurance would cost him $1,848/month?"

Claude: [Activates skill, applies 9.12% affordability rule]

        Result: YES - Coverage is unaffordable ($1,848 > $1,003 threshold)
                Since you sponsor his H-1B, he qualifies for subsidies
```

### Example 3: Full Analysis
```
You: "Analyze insurance options for Rajesh (H-1B, $132k income,
      family of 4). I have quotes from 3 agents in these emails."
      [Attach email files]

Claude: [Activates skill]
        [Extracts all quote data]
        [Calculates costs for all options]
        [Analyzes subsidy eligibility]
        [Generates comprehensive report]

        Result: 15-page formatted comparison report with clear recommendation
```

## 🎓 How It Works (Technical)

### Progressive Disclosure System

Claude reads a short description from the YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
description: Analyzes and compares health insurance plans (individual vs
             group), calculates costs, verifies networks, and generates
             formatted comparison reports for decision-making
```

**Token Efficient:**
- Skill metadata: ~50 tokens
- Full skill content: Only loaded when needed
- Your conversation: No unnecessary token usage

### Automatic Activation

Claude automatically loads this skill when you:
- Mention "insurance comparison" or "health insurance quotes"
- Ask about "individual vs group insurance"
- Discuss "H-1B subsidies" or "ICHRA"
- Request cost analysis or formatted reports

**You don't need to manually invoke it** - Claude decides based on context.
