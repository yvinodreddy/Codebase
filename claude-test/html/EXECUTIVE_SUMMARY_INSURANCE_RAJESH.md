## 🔑 KEY DISCOVERY

**Rajesh QUALIFIES for $866/month marketplace subsidy!**

**Why?** Paragroup sponsors his H-1B visa, and his share of group insurance ($1,848/month) exceeds the affordability threshold ($1,003/month for $132K income).

**ACA Affordability Rule:**
- Income: $132,000/year
- 9.12% threshold: $1,003/month
- Group insurance cost: $1,848/month
- **$1,848 > $1,003 = UNAFFORDABLE**
- ✅ Qualifies for subsidy!

## 🎯 WHAT TO TELL RAJESH

**Script:**
```
"Good news! I found insurance that saves you $1,128 per month.

OPTION 1 (Recommended):
Your cost: $648/month (with company helping $72/month)
Savings: $1,200/month vs group plan
Dr. Mary Lare: Still in-network ✅
Better copays: $25 primary care

OPTION 2 (Group Plan):
Your cost: $1,848/month
More expensive by $1,200/month

You qualify for a government subsidy because your share
of group insurance would be 'unaffordable' under ACA rules.

Which do you prefer? I recommend Option 1."

## ⚠️ WHY NOT SMALL GROUP?

**Business Impact:**
- Current monthly profit: $400-500
- Small group cost: $205/month
- **New profit: $195-295/month** (40-50% reduction)
- ❌ NOT SUSTAINABLE

**Employee Impact:**
- Rajesh pays: $1,848/month
- vs. Individual: $648/month
- **Loses $1,200/month** in savings
- ❌ NOT OPTIMAL

**Financial Reality:**
Your 80/20 revenue split with thin margins makes small group insurance financially impossible. Individual insurance is the ONLY viable path forward.

## 💡 TAX OPTIMIZATION: ICHRA

**What is ICHRA?**
Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement - reimburse Rajesh's premium tax-free.

**How It Works:**
1. Rajesh buys insurance: $719.92/month (with subsidy)
2. Company reimburses: $72/month (10%)
3. Rajesh gets money tax-free
4. Company gets tax deduction

**Benefits:**
- Rajesh's final cost: $647.92/month
- Company's cost: $72/month (vs $205 for group)
- **Both save money!**

**Setup:** Talk to your accountant (optional, can add later)
