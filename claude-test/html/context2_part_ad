The insurance isn't "more expensive per person" if you add yourself - you just have MORE people to cover, so total cost goes up.

ANSWER CHUCK HACKEL'S QUESTION THIS WAY
Send the email I drafted earlier, which says:

"The employee being insured is NOT the owner. Rajesh Kumar Gupta (non-owner employee) needs coverage. I (Vinod, the owner) will NOT be covered."

This is:
✓ True
✓ ACA compliant
✓ What you can afford
✓ The right answer

CAN YOU ADD YOURSELF LATER?
YES! If your business grows and you can afford it:

Qualifying events that let you add yourself mid-year:

Loss of other coverage
Marriage
Birth of child
Significant income change
Or wait until annual renewal and add yourself then.

BOTTOM LINE
Your plan:

Cover Rajesh only (not yourself)
Your cost: ~$600/month (affordable)
Get your own coverage separately through marketplace if needed
Add yourself to the company plan later when business grows
Send the email to Chuck Hackel confirming Rajesh (non-owner) needs coverage and you (owner) will not be covered.

This is the smart, financially responsible decision.

Does this make sense? Should we proceed with covering just Rajesh?

I have explained the whole situation I am not saving any money in here right because we are working on a 80 20 percentage basis and I am looking to take the liability insurance workers comp insurance and then the invoice factoring 237 and then the trade credit insurance around $870 on that and then we are paying the state taxes and then payroll charges you see I don't have any margins to save there so what do you think that I have to tell him because out of 20% I am getting zero benefit here so if you are still Paying me to asking me to pay another 600 it means I'm paying from my pocket when employees working on top of it whatever the business we are running is I am at the loss of negative plus money that I am paying it you see what I am saying because the total rate for this project is 66 per hour and then the employee is getting 80% of it and out of 20% I am covering all this above So I'm not saving anything in here you see what I mean Because here employees working on the percentage basis not in a full time salary basis so we are not saving any margins or like a lot of money that we can pay you see what I mean 


Analyzed thin margins, proposed strategic solutions for business sustainability.
15s












You're absolutely right, and I understand your situation now. Let me be completely honest with you about your options.

YOUR REAL FINANCIAL SITUATION
Monthly Revenue Split:

Client pays: $66/hour × 173 hours = $11,418/month
Rajesh gets (80%): $9,134/month gross
You get (20%): $2,284/month gross
Your Costs from that $2,284:

TCI insurance: $870
Factoring: $237
Workers comp: ~$200
General liability: ~$150
State taxes: ~$200-300
Payroll processing: ~$100
Total costs: ~$1,750-1,850/month
Your actual profit: $400-500/month (maybe less)

If you pay $600/month for health insurance contribution: You're losing $100-200/month running this business.

THE HARD TRUTH
You cannot afford to pay ANY health insurance contribution with your current margins.

You have three realistic options:

OPTION 1: MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION (10%) - What You Can Afford
New Jersey law requires only 10% minimum employer contribution.

If health insurance costs $2,400/month:

Your contribution (10%): $240/month
Rajesh pays (90%): $2,160/month
Your actual cost: $240/month (painful but possible)

Impact on your business:

Current profit: $400-500/month
Minus health insurance: -$240/month
New profit: $160-260/month
You're barely making anything, but at least not losing money.

OPTION 2: RAISE YOUR CLIENT RATE (Best Solution)
Ask your client for a rate increase to cover health insurance:

Current rate: $66/hour New rate needed: $69-70/hour (4.5-6% increase)

Additional revenue:

$3/hour × 173 hours = $519/month extra
This covers your health insurance contribution + keeps your profit
How to approach the client:

"We're implementing a comprehensive benefits package for our consultants including health insurance. To continue providing the same level of quality service, we need to adjust our rate to $69/hour, effective November 1st. This is our first rate adjustment and aligns with market rates for skilled IT consultants with benefits."

This is the BEST option - it lets you offer insurance without destroying your business.

OPTION 3: DON'T OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE
Reality check:

Many small consulting firms your size DON'T offer health insurance
Rajesh can buy individual insurance (expensive for H-1B, but possible)
You're not legally required to offer it
But this creates problems:

Rajesh needs insurance (H-1B visa considerations)
You may lose him as an employee
Makes hiring future employees harder
WHAT TO TELL CHUCK HACKEL (Email Template)
Given your situation, here's what you should send:

Subject: RE: Health Insurance Quote Request - Employer Contribution Question

Hi Chuck,

Thank you for your response. To answer your question: The employee being insured (Rajesh Kumar Gupta) is a non-owner employee, not the business owner. I (Vinod) am the owner and will not be covered under this plan, so this meets ACA requirements.

However, I need to be transparent about our budget constraints. We are a small consulting firm with very tight margins. We can commit to the New Jersey minimum requirement of 10% employer contribution, with the employee paying 90% of the premium.

Given this structure, can you please provide quotes showing:
1. Total monthly premium for employee + family
2. Cost breakdown: 10% employer / 90% employee
3. Options at different coverage levels (to help keep costs manageable)

I want to offer health insurance to my employee, but need to ensure it works within our business model.

Employee details:
- Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, non-tobacco
- Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, non-tobacco
- Child 1: DOB 04/16/2016
- Child 2: DOB 07/03/2024
- Location: Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
- Coverage start: November 1, 2025

Please let me know if you can work with a 10% employer contribution, or if you have alternative suggestions.

Thank you,

Vinod Yellagonda

MY HONEST RECOMMENDATION
Here's what you should do, in order:

STEP 1: Try to Raise Your Client Rate
Email/call your client THIS WEEK
Request $69-70/hour starting November 1st
Explain you're adding employee benefits
4-6% increase is reasonable and they'll likely accept
If client says YES:

You can afford 25% contribution (~$600/month)
Your profit stays around $400-500/month
Everyone wins
If client says NO:

Move to Step 2
STEP 2: Offer Insurance with 10% Contribution
Tell Rajesh: "I'm offering health insurance through the company. NJ law requires I contribute 10%, you'll pay 90%."
Your cost: $240/month (painful but manageable)
Rajesh pays: $2,160/month (but still better than individual market for H-1B)
Benefits to Rajesh even at 90% employee contribution:

Group rates are cheaper than individual (saves ~$500-800/month)
Pre-tax payroll deduction (saves him ~$650/month in taxes)
No pre-existing condition issues
Good for visa documentation
Net savings to him: ~$1,000/month vs. buying individual insurance
STEP 3: Revisit in 6 Months
When you get a rate increase or more clients
Increase your contribution to 25-50%
Make it a performance incentive
ALTERNATIVE: PEO MODEL
Consider joining a PEO (Professional Employer Organization):

Companies like Justworks, TriNet, ADP TotalSource

How it works:

They become co-employer
You get Fortune 500-level benefits at small business prices
They handle ALL payroll, taxes, insurance, HR
Might actually be CHEAPER overall
Cost: 2-12% of payroll (~$183-1,096/month on Rajesh's salary)

Benefits:

Better health insurance rates (large group pricing)
They handle workers comp, liability, payroll taxes
Reduces your administrative burden
May save money overall by consolidating everything
Worth exploring: Call Justworks (1-888-534-1711) and get a quote for comparison

THE MATH: CAN RAJESH AFFORD 90% CONTRIBUTION?
Rajesh's situation:

Gross pay: $9,134/month
Minus payroll taxes: ~-$1,465/month
Take-home before health insurance: ~$7,669/month
With 90% health insurance contribution:

Health insurance (pre-tax): -$2,160/month
Take-home after insurance: ~$5,509/month
For a family of 4 in NJ:

This is tight but workable
Median household income in NJ: ~$6,000/month
He's below median but not poverty level
Why he should accept this:

Individual insurance would cost him $3,000+/month AFTER taxes
Group insurance saves him ~$1,000/month even at 90% contribution
He gets continuous coverage for visa purposes
BOTTOM LINE - WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW
Email Chuck Hackel with the message I wrote above (10% employer contribution)
Email/call your client requesting rate increase to $69-70/hour
Talk to Rajesh honestly:
"I want to offer you health insurance through the company
Due to our tight margins, I can contribute 10% (NJ minimum)
You'd pay 90%, which is about $2,160/month
This is still better than individual insurance by ~$1,000/month
If our client approves a rate increase, I'll increase my contribution"
Get quotes from all 3 agents (Knox, Sanchez, Hackel) and see actual pricing
Explore PEO option (Justworks) as it might be cheaper overall
THE HARSH REALITY
Your 80/20 split with all these overhead costs is not sustainable if you want to offer benefits.

You need to either:

Increase your client rate
Renegotiate the 80/20 split with Rajesh (maybe 75/25 or 70/30)
Join a PEO to reduce overall costs
Not offer health insurance
You're right that you're not making money. This is the reality of small consulting/staffing firms. Most either:

Charge higher rates ($80-100+/hour for skilled IT consultants)
Take larger margins (30-40%, not 20%)
Don't offer benefits
Use PEOs to reduce costs
My advice: Email Chuck with 10% contribution offer, try to raise your client rate, and be honest with Rajesh about the cost-sharing. You cannot afford more than 10% contribution without losing money.

Does this make sense? What do you want to do?

I got another response can you phrase an email to send it to them


Identified coverage type mismatch and clarified small group insurance requirements.





Great! Another response from Adriana Molina. However, I notice she's asking for income information, which suggests she might be thinking about individual marketplace insurance instead of small group business insurance. Let me draft a clarifying email.

EMAIL RESPONSE TO ADRIANA MOLINA
Subject: RE: Small Business Health Insurance Quote Request - Group Coverage Details

Email:

Hi Adriana,

Thank you for your quick response and for offering to help.

To clarify: I'm seeking SMALL GROUP health insurance for my business (employer-sponsored coverage), not individual marketplace insurance. This is group coverage through Paragroup LLC for one employee and his family.

However, here is the information you requested:

EMPLOYEE & FAMILY DATES OF BIRTH:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta - DOB: June 21, 1981
Spouse: Sonali Kiran - DOB: November 11, 1992
Child 1: Hridhaan Gupta - DOB: April 16, 2016
Child 2: Kevit Gupta - DOB: July 3, 2024

HOME ZIP CODE: 07920 (Basking Ridge, NJ)

REGARDING INCOME:
For small group business insurance, income is typically not required as pricing is based on age, location, and plan type. If you're considering an alternative approach (such as ICHRA or individual coverage reimbursement), I'm open to learning about those options, but my primary need is traditional small group coverage.

PHONE CALL:
Yes, I'm available for a call tomorrow (Friday) at 3:15 PM. Please call me at (732) 986-3033.

However, if possible, could you also send preliminary quotes via email before our call? This will help me compare options efficiently since I'm getting quotes from multiple brokers.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
Company: Paragroup LLC
Federal EIN: 37-2028003
Total Employees: 2 (1 enrolling)
Employee is H-1B visa holder
Spouse is H-4 dependent
One child is US citizen

Current coverage: Anthem BCBS PPO ending Oct 31, 2025
New coverage needed: November 1, 2025

I'm seeking PPO or EPO plans from carriers like Horizon BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, or AmeriHealth, with employer contribution of 10-25% of premium.

Looking forward to our call tomorrow at 3:15 PM.

## WHY I CLARIFIED THE "GROUP vs. INDIVIDUAL" ISSUE

**Adriana asked for income information**, which is typically needed for:
- Individual/family marketplace plans (where subsidies depend on income)
- ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement)

**But you need SMALL GROUP insurance**, where:
- Income doesn't matter
- Only age, location, tobacco use, and plan type matter
- This is employer-sponsored through your business

**She might:**
1. Be confused about what you're asking for, OR
2. Be proposing an ICHRA alternative (where employees buy individual insurance and you reimburse them)

**The email clarifies this while remaining open to alternatives.**

---

## PREPARE FOR FRIDAY 3:15 PM CALL

**What to have ready:**
✓ Rajesh's completed insurance form
✓ Notepad to take notes
✓ Calendar in case you need to schedule follow-up
✓ List of questions

**Key points to emphasize on the call:**
1. You need small group business insurance
2. Coverage must start November 1st (tight timeline)
3. You can contribute 10-25% as employer
4. Employee is H-1B visa holder (affects some options)
5. Need Dr. Mary Lare, DO in network

Hi Chuck,

Thank you for your response. To answer your questions:

REGARDING ACA COMPLIANCE:
The employee being insured (Rajesh Kumar Gupta) is a non-owner employee, not the business owner. I (Vinod Yellagonda) am the owner and will NOT be covered under this plan. This meets ACA requirements.

REGARDING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION:
Due to budget constraints, we can commit to 10% employer contribution (NJ minimum requirement), with the employee paying 90% of the premium.

Can you provide quotes showing:
- Total monthly premium for employee + family
- Cost breakdown: 10% employer / 90% employee
- PPO and EPO options from multiple carriers

EMAIL TO ADRIANA MOLINA (Requesting Both Options)
Subject: RE: Small Business Health Insurance Quote Request - Both Group & Individual Options

Email:

Hi Adriana,

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate your help with this.

I would like to request quotes for BOTH options so I can compare which approach is more cost-effective:

OPTION 1: SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE (through Paragroup LLC)
OPTION 2: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE INSURANCE (for comparison)

Here is the complete information:

---

EMPLOYEE & FAMILY INFORMATION:

Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta
- DOB: June 21, 1981
- Status: H-1B visa holder
- Annual Income: $132,000
- Non-tobacco user

Child 2: Kevit Gupta
- DOB: July 3, 2024
- Status: US Citizen (born in USA)

Home ZIP Code: 07920 (Basking Ridge, NJ)

---

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT VISA STATUS & ACA:

- The employee (H-1B) and spouse/child on H-4 visas CANNOT receive premium tax credits or subsidies on the marketplace
- However, they CAN purchase marketplace insurance at full price
- The US citizen child (Kevit) may be eligible for CHIP or subsidies
- Employee's estimated 2024 household income: $132,000

---

WHAT I'RE REQUESTING:

OPTION 1 - SMALL GROUP INSURANCE:
- Quote through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- Group coverage for employee + family (4 people)
- PPO or EPO plans from Horizon BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, AmeriHealth
- Show 10% employer contribution / 90% employee contribution
- Coverage effective: November 1, 2025

OPTION 2 - INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE INSURANCE:
- Individual/family plan through GetCoveredNJ marketplace
- Same coverage (employee + spouse + 2 children)
- PPO or EPO plans
- Full premium cost (no subsidies for H-1B/H-4 holders)
- Explore if US citizen child qualifies for CHIP separately
- Coverage effective: November 1, 2025

---

WHY I'M REQUESTING BOTH:

I want to compare:
1. Group insurance with 10% employer contribution
2. Individual insurance (possibly with ICHRA reimbursement arrangement)

This will help me determine which approach is more cost-effective for both the business and the employee.

---

CURRENT COVERAGE:
Carrier: Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO
Policy ending: October 31, 2025
Current premium: $645/month

REQUIREMENTS:
- Must include Dr. Mary Lare, DO (Basking Ridge, NJ) in network
- Coverage must start November 1, 2025 (tight timeline)

PHONE CALL FRIDAY:
Yes, I'm available for a call tomorrow (Friday) at 3:15 PM. Please call me at (732) 986-3033.

If possible, could you send preliminary quotes via email before our call? This will help me prepare questions and make our conversation more efficient.

Thank you for your assistance with both options. I'm comparing quotes from multiple brokers and need to make a decision by early next week.

## WHY THIS APPROACH IS SMART

**You'll be able to compare:**

### **Option 1: Group Insurance (10% contribution)**
- Total premium: ~$2,400/month (estimated)
- Your cost: $240/month (10%)
- Rajesh pays: $2,160/month

### **Option 2: Individual Insurance (ICHRA approach)**
- Employee buys individual insurance: ~$2,800-3,200/month (no subsidies for H-1B)
- You reimburse via ICHRA: Whatever amount you choose
- US citizen child might qualify for CHIP: ~$0-50/month

**Then you can decide which is cheaper overall.**

---

## ABOUT THE US CITIZEN CHILD & CHIP

**Important opportunity:** Since Kevit (1 year old) is a US citizen, he might qualify for NJ FamilyCare (CHIP) even if the rest of the family doesn't.

**NJ FamilyCare (CHIP) eligibility for a family of 4:**
- Income limit: ~$115,000/year for a family of 4
- Since Rajesh makes $132K, the child **might not qualify**
- But worth checking - could save $150-200/month if eligible

**Adriana can check this for you.**

---

## THE ACA CLARIFICATION (Important)

You're right to clarify, so let me be precise:

**What H-1B visa holders CAN do:**
✓ Enroll in employer-sponsored group health insurance (what you're doing)
✓ Buy individual insurance on the ACA marketplace
✓ Get ACA-compliant plans with pre-existing condition protections

**What H-1B visa holders CANNOT do:**
✗ Receive premium tax credits/subsidies on the marketplace
✗ Qualify for Medicaid (in most states)
✗ Get the discounted "subsidized" rates

**So when I said "ACA-compliant" earlier, I meant:**
- All small group insurance follows ACA rules (pre-existing conditions covered, essential benefits, etc.)
- But H-1B holders don't get the financial subsidies that citizens get

**This is why group insurance is often better for H-1B holders** - group rates are typically 20-30% cheaper than individual rates even WITHOUT subsidies.

---

## INCOME CLARIFICATION FOR QUOTES

**You said salary is $130-132K. Let me clarify:**

**For GROUP insurance quotes:**
- Income is NOT asked
- Not relevant to pricing
- Just provide ages, location, tobacco use

**For INDIVIDUAL marketplace quotes:**
- Income IS asked
- Use: **$132,000** (to show they don't qualify for subsidies)
- This is household income for the family

**The email I drafted uses $132,000 which is fine.**

---

## ALSO SEND UPDATED EMAIL TO CHUCK HACKEL

Since you want both options explored, also update Chuck:

**Subject:** RE: Health Insurance Quote Request - Request for Both Group & Individual Options
```
Hi Chuck,

Thank you for your response. To answer your questions:

The employee being insured (Rajesh Kumar Gupta) is a non-owner employee on H-1B visa. I (Vinod, the owner) will NOT be covered. This meets ACA requirements.

REQUEST: Can you quote BOTH options for comparison?

OPTION 1 - SMALL GROUP:
- Group coverage through Paragroup LLC
- Employee + family (4 people)
- 10% employer / 90% employee contribution
- PPO and EPO plans

OPTION 2 - INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE:
- Individual coverage for same family
- Full premium (no subsidies - H-1B visa holders)
- To compare with potential ICHRA arrangement

EMPLOYEE DETAILS:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, H-1B visa, income $132K
Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, H-4 visa
Child 1: DOB 04/16/2016, H-4 visa
Child 2: DOB 07/03/2024, US citizen
Location: Basking Ridge, NJ 07920

This will help me determine the most cost-effective approach.

Thank you,
Vinod

YOUR ACTION PLAN
Tonight:

Send updated email to Adriana Molina ✓
Send updated email to Chuck Hackel ✓
Friday 3:15 PM:

Take call from Adriana
Discuss both group and individual options
Ask about CHIP eligibility for US citizen child
Next Week:

Compare quotes for both approaches
Calculate total costs:
Group with 10% contribution
Individual with ICHRA reimbursement
Make decision based on which is cheaper
ESTIMATED COSTS (For Your Planning)
OPTION 1 - GROUP INSURANCE:

Premium: ~$2,400/month
Your cost (10%): ~$240/month
Rajesh cost (90%): ~$2,160/month
OPTION 2 - INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE:

Premium (no subsidies): ~$2,800-3,200/month
If you don't reimburse: $0 for you, $2,800-3,200 for Rajesh
If you reimburse $500/month: $500 for you, $2,300-2,700 for Rajesh
OPTION 3 - INDIVIDUAL + CHIP for citizen child:

Individual for 3 people (employee + spouse + 1 child): ~$2,400-2,800/month
CHIP for US citizen child: ~$0-50/month (if qualifies)
Might save $200-400/month vs full individual coverage
Group insurance is likely still the best option, but getting both quotes lets you confirm this.

Send those emails now! You're doing great by exploring all options.

Hi Chuck,
Thank you for your response. To answer your question: The employee being insured (Rajesh Kumar Gupta) is a non-owner employee, not the business owner. I (Vinod) am the owner and will not be covered under this plan, so this meets ACA requirements.
However, I need to be transparent about our budget constraints. We are a small consulting firm with very tight margins. We can commit to the New Jersey minimum requirement of 10% employer contribution, with the employee paying 90% of the premium.
Given this structure, can you please provide quotes showing:
1. Total monthly premium for employee + family
2. Cost breakdown: 10% employer / 90% employee
3. Options at different coverage levels (to help keep costs manageable)
I want to offer health insurance to my employee, but need to ensure it works within our business model.
Employee details:
- Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, non-tobacco
- Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, non-tobacco
- Child 1: DOB 04/16/2016
- Child 2: DOB 07/03/2024
- Location: Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
- Coverage start: November 1, 2025
Please let me know if you can work with a 10% employer contribution, or if you have alternative suggestions.
Thank you,
