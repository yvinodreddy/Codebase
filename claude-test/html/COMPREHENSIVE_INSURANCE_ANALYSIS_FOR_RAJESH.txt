        COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE ANALYSIS FOR RAJESH GUPTA
          Paragroup LLC - October 2025 Coverage Options Analysis
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
After extensive research and quotes from 3 insurance agents (Chuck Hackel,
Jolly Luthra, Adriana Molina), we have identified significant cost savings
opportunities. The BEST option can save up to $5,600-$20,000 per year compared
to small group insurance.

KEY FINDING: Individual Marketplace insurance is SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER than
small group business insurance, even without subsidies.

EMPLOYEE INFORMATION
================================================================================
Employee:       Rajesh Kumar Gupta
DOB:            June 21, 1981 (Age 44)
Status:         H-1B visa (sponsored by Paragroup LLC)
Spouse:         Sonali Kiran, DOB: Nov 11, 1992 (Age 32, H-4 visa)
Child 1:        Hridhaan Gupta, DOB: Apr 16, 2016 (Age 9, H-4 visa)
Child 2:        Kevit Gupta, DOB: Jul 3, 2024 (Age 1, US citizen)
Location:       Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
Annual Income:  $132,000

Current Plan:   Anthem BCBS PPO - $645/month (ending Oct 31, 2025)
                Employer contribution: $210/month (33%)
                Employee pays: $435/month (67%)

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: H-1B AFFORDABILITY RULE
================================================================================
Since Paragroup LLC sponsors Rajesh's H-1B visa, he MAY qualify for Marketplace
premium tax credits if employer-sponsored coverage is "unaffordable."

ACA Affordability Threshold: 9.12% of household income
For Rajesh: $132,000 × 9.12% = $12,038/year = $1,003/month

If Rajesh's share of group insurance costs MORE than $1,003/month, he qualifies
for subsidies even though he is H-1B!

================================================================================
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

1. DOCTOR NETWORK STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dr. Mary Catherine Lare, DO
   Address: 18 Lyons Rd, Suite 101, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
   Phone: 973-379-2111

   Network Acceptance (per Jolly Luthra):
   ✓ UnitedHealthcare - IN NETWORK
   ✓ AmeriHealth - IN NETWORK
   ✗ Oscar - NOT IN NETWORK
   ✗ Horizon BCBS - NOT IN NETWORK (database shows "permanently closed")
   ✗ Aetna CVS - NOT IN NETWORK

   NOTE: Chuck Hackel's system shows Dr. Lare's office as "permanently closed"
   but she may have moved or database is outdated. VERIFY BEFORE CHOOSING PLAN.

   **RECOMMENDATION IF DR. LARE IS NOT MANDATORY:**
   You have more carrier options available. Consider:
   - Horizon plans (often competitive pricing)
   - Oscar plans (tech-forward, good reviews)

   If willing to change doctors, this opens up more competitive options.


2. H-1B VISA CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ✓ H-1B visa holders CAN get group or individual insurance
   ✓ Pre-existing conditions are covered (ACA protection)
   ✓ H-1B visa holders USUALLY cannot get subsidies

   ✗ EXCEPTION: If employer coverage is "unaffordable" (>9.12% of income)
                 AND the employer sponsors the H-1B visa
                 THEN the H-1B holder may qualify for subsidies

   For Rajesh:
   - Income: $132,000
   - Affordability threshold: $1,003/month
   - Cheapest small group employee cost: $1,848/month
   - Since $1,848 > $1,003, employer coverage is "UNAFFORDABLE"
   - Therefore: Rajesh MAY qualify for $866/month subsidy!

   **ACTION REQUIRED:** Adriana Molina is verifying this. Await her confirmation.


3. TAX BENEFITS COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Small Group Insurance:
   ✓ Employee pays premium PRE-TAX through payroll
   ✓ Saves ~30% in taxes ($554/month on $1,848 premium)
   ✓ Net cost to Rajesh: ~$1,294/month after tax savings
   ✓ Company contribution is tax-deductible

   Individual Marketplace (without ICHRA):
   ✗ Employee pays premium AFTER-TAX
   ✗ No payroll deduction benefit
   ✓ May still be cheaper overall due to lower premium

   Individual Marketplace (with ICHRA):
   ✓ Company reimburses employee TAX-FREE
   ✓ Employee gets lower premium + tax benefit
   ✓ Company gets business tax deduction
   ✓ BEST OF BOTH WORLDS

   **RECOMMENDATION:** If going individual route, set up ICHRA to get tax benefits.


4. ICHRA (Individual Coverage HRA) OPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   What is ICHRA?
   - Allows company to reimburse employee's individual insurance premium
   - Reimbursement is TAX-FREE to employee
   - Reimbursement is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE for company
   - Legal for H-1B visa holders
   - No minimum or maximum reimbursement amount

   How it works for Rajesh:
   1. Rajesh buys individual insurance: $1,586/month
   2. Company reimburses him: $159/month (10%)
   3. Rajesh's net cost: $1,427/month
   4. Company's cost: $159/month

   Benefits:
   ✓ Lower premium than small group
   ✓ Tax-free reimbursement for Rajesh
   ✓ Tax deduction for company
   ✓ Saves ~$46/month vs. small group ($552/year)

   **ACTION REQUIRED:** Consult with accountant to set up ICHRA correctly.


5. PROS AND CONS OF EACH APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE WITH SUBSIDIES:
   Pros:
   ✓ CHEAPEST option ($720/month vs $1,848+ for group)
   ✓ Saves $1,128+ per month vs. small group
   ✓ Same quality coverage (Silver tier, AmeriHealth)
   ✓ No company contribution required

   ✗ Employee pays after-tax (unless ICHRA set up)

   ✓ No doctor restriction if not in network

   Cons:
   ✗ Employee pays after-tax (unless ICHRA set up)
   ✗ More expensive than subsidized option
   ✗ Less "professional" benefit image


   SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE:
   Pros:
   ✓ Professional employer benefit
   ✓ Pre-tax payroll deduction for employee
   ✓ Good for H-1B visa documentation
   ✓ Easier administration through payroll
   ✓ Multiple carrier options

   Cons:
   ✗ MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE ($467-1,128/month more)
   ✗ Company MUST contribute 10% minimum ($205+/month)
   ✗ Higher out-of-pocket maximums
   ✗ Worse copays (after deductible on some plans)
   ✗ Limited doctor network per plan

================================================================================
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Why is individual insurance cheaper than small group?
A: Individual marketplace is competitive due to:
   - Community rating (can't adjust for health)
   - Administrative costs for employer plans
   - Larger risk pool in individual market
   - ACA marketplace competition

Q: Can H-1B visa holders get marketplace subsidies?
A: Usually NO, but YES if employer coverage is "unaffordable" (>9.12% of income)
   and the employer sponsors their H-1B visa. Rajesh may qualify!

Q: What is ICHRA and why should we use it?
A: ICHRA = Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement
   Allows company to reimburse employee's individual insurance TAX-FREE
   Benefits: Lower premiums + tax advantages = best of both worlds

Q: Do we have to contribute if Rajesh buys individual insurance?
A: NO. There's no legal requirement. But you can if you want to help:
   - Option 1: No contribution ($0/month)
   - Option 2: ICHRA contribution ($159/month = 10%)
   - Option 3: Higher ICHRA ($300-500/month if you want to help more)

Q: What if we decide not to offer health insurance at all?
A: Legal options:
   - You're not required to offer insurance (only 2 employees)
   - Rajesh would buy individual insurance himself (no subsidy if not H-1B sponsored)
   - Cost to Rajesh: $1,586/month (no employer help)
   - Not recommended: Rajesh needs insurance and you'd likely lose him as employee

Q: Which plan has the best coverage regardless of cost?
A: Small Group: Horizon OMNIA Gold ($2,838/month)
   - Lowest deductible: $1,500/$3,000
   - Lowest OOP max: $7,900/$15,800
   - Best copays: $25 PCP / $50 specialist
   - But costs $25,416 MORE per year than subsidized individual!


================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

✅ COST: $1,427/month for Rajesh, $159/month for company (optional)
✅ SAVINGS: $5,604/year vs. small group
✅ ACTION: Enroll via marketplace + set up ICHRA with accountant

ONLY IF INDIVIDUAL IS NOT POSSIBLE:

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The data clearly shows that INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE INSURANCE is significantly
cheaper than small group insurance for Rajesh's situation, even without
subsidies. With potential subsidies (if qualified), the savings are enormous.

BEST CASE SCENARIO (with subsidies):
Save $15,996 per year vs. small group
Rajesh pays $720/month (vs. $1,848/month for group)
Company pays $0/month (vs. $205/month for group)

REALISTIC SCENARIO (no subsidies + ICHRA):
Save $5,604 per year vs. small group
Rajesh pays $1,427/month (vs. $1,848/month for group)
Company pays $159/month (vs. $205/month for group)

NEXT STEP: Confirm subsidy eligibility with Adriana Molina, then enroll
immediately to ensure November 1 coverage.
