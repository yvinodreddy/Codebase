---

### OPTION B: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE + ICHRA (RECOMMENDED)

**Best Plan: AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO**

**Monthly Costs (Without ICHRA):**
- Total Premium: $1,585.92/month
- Employer Contribution: $0/month

## FINANCIAL COMPARISON - THE BOTTOM LINE

### Annual Cost Comparison:

| Category | Small Group | Individual + ICHRA | Savings |
|----------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Total Premium** | $24,640/year | $19,031/year | **$5,609/year** |
| **Employer Cost** | $2,464/year | $1,903/year | **$561/year** |
| **Employee Cost (Pre-tax)** | ~$15,552/year* | $17,128/year | -$1,576/year |
| **Employee Cost (After-tax)** | ~$22,176/year | $17,128/year | **$5,048/year** |

*Assumes 30% tax bracket savings on pre-tax deduction

### Key Insight:
Even though the employee loses the pre-tax benefit with individual insurance, they STILL save **$262-421/month** because the base premium is so much cheaper.

**With ICHRA Setup:**
- Employee saves: $421/month = $5,052/year
- Company saves: $47/month = $564/year
- **Total Family Savings: $5,616/year**

**What It Is:**

**How It Works:**

1. **Rajesh buys individual insurance:** $1,585.92/month

3. **Rajesh's net cost:** $1,427.33/month
4. **Tax benefits:**

## CRITICAL ISSUE: DR. MARY LARE NETWORK STATUS

### The Problem:
Chuck Hackel reports: "Dr. Mary Lare's office shows as permanently closed"

### The Reality:
**Dr. Mary Catherine Lare, DO**
- Address: 18 Lyons Rd, Suite 101, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
- Phone: 973-379-2111
- Jolly Luthra confirmed: Accepts UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth

### Action Required:
1. **Call Dr. Lare's office TODAY:** 973-379-2111
2. Verify she is currently practicing
3. Confirm she accepts:
   - AmeriHealth plans
   - UnitedHealthcare plans
4. Ask if office location or network status has changed

**If office is closed:** Need to find new PCP before selecting insurance plan.

## H-1B VISA CONSIDERATIONS

### Key Points for Rajesh:

**Subsidy Eligibility:**
- H-1B and H-4 visa holders: CANNOT receive marketplace premium tax credits
- US citizen child: MIGHT qualify for CHIP (NJ FamilyCare)
  - Income limit for family of 4: ~$115,000/year
  - Rajesh's income: $132,000/year
  - **Likely does NOT qualify** (over income limit)

**Insurance Options:**
✅ Can purchase individual marketplace insurance (at full price)
✅ Can participate in employer-sponsored group insurance
✅ Cannot receive subsidies/tax credits on marketplace
✅ ICHRA reimbursements ARE allowed for H-1B holders

**Visa Documentation:**
✅ Both individual and group insurance provide continuous coverage documentation
✅ Individual insurance is ACA-compliant (meets visa requirements)
✅ No immigration issues with either option

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Go with INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE if:

✅ You can set up ICHRA with your accountant
✅ Dr. Mary Lare accepts AmeriHealth individual plans
✅ Rajesh is comfortable with individual insurance
✅ You want to save company money ($561/year)

### Go with SMALL GROUP if:

**Mitigation:** Verify today, find alternative PCP if needed

- **Premium:** $1,585.92/month
- **Employer ICHRA Reimbursement:** $158.59/month (10%)

3. **Flexibility:** Rajesh owns the policy (not tied to employment)
4. **Tax Benefits:** ICHRA provides tax-free reimbursement

If ICHRA setup is too complex or Dr. Mary Lare is not in-network:
- **Fallback:** Small Group AmeriHealth Silver EPO through Chuck Hackel
- **Cost:** $2,053.33/month ($205 employer, $1,848 employee)
