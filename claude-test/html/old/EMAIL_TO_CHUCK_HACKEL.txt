SUBJECT: RE: Small Group vs. Individual Insurance - Questions and Decision

---

Hi Chuck,

Thank you for the comprehensive quotes and for your honest assessment that "if the bottom line premium is most important then go with the less expensive option."

I appreciate your transparency - that's exactly the kind of professional guidance I need.

I have a few questions before making my final decision:

## 1. CRITICAL: DR. MARY LARE NETWORK STATUS

You mentioned that Dr. Mary Lare's office shows as "permanently closed" in your system. However, my employee was recently seeing her at:

**Dr. Mary Catherine Lare, DO**
18 Lyons Rd, Suite 101
Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
Phone: 973-379-2111

Can you please verify her current network status with AmeriHealth Silver EPO? I'm going to call her office today to confirm she's still practicing, but I need to know if she's in-network for the plan you quoted.

This is a critical requirement - if she's not in-network, we need to explore other options.

## 2. INDIVIDUAL vs. SMALL GROUP COMPARISON

I've been comparing the costs carefully:

**SMALL GROUP (Your Quote):**
- AmeriHealth Silver EPO: $2,053.33/month
- Employer pays (10%): $205.33/month
- Employee pays (90%): $1,848.00/month pre-tax
- Annual total: $24,640

**INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE (Other broker's quote):**
- AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO: $1,585.92/month
- No subsidies (H-1B not eligible)
- Employee pays: $1,585.92/month
- Annual total: $19,031

**Difference: $5,609/year savings with individual marketplace**

Even after accounting for the pre-tax benefit of group insurance (saving Rajesh ~$554/month in taxes), the individual marketplace plan would still save approximately:
- Company: $205/month (we don't have to contribute)
- Employee: ~$262/month (after tax benefit loss)
- **Total savings: ~$467/month = $5,604/year**

## 3. UNDERSTANDING THE PREMIUM DIFFERENCE

You mentioned there are "coverage differences" that explain the premium difference. I reviewed both Summary of Benefits and noticed:

**Individual Plan ADVANTAGES:**
- Lower out-of-pocket max: $9,000 vs $9,200
- Better primary care copay: $25 vs $30-50
- Simpler plan structure (no tier system)

**Small Group ADVANTAGES:**
- Pre-tax payroll deduction
- 2-tier provider network (though some require deductible)

The coverage appears similar or slightly better with individual insurance, yet it's $467/month cheaper. Can you help me understand why small group costs significantly more for essentially the same coverage from the same carrier?

Is it because:
- Community rating for small groups?
- Administrative costs?
- Different risk pool?

## 4. W-2 EMPLOYEE STATUS

Yes, Rajesh is a W-2 employee on our payroll with regular paychecks and tax withholding, so he qualifies for group insurance.

## 5. ICHRA OPTION

You mentioned I should "check with your accountant of the rules of paying the premium for an individual plan for an employee."

I'm researching ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement) which would allow me to:
- Have employee buy individual insurance ($1,586/month)
- Reimburse him tax-free via ICHRA ($159/month = 10%)
- He gets both lower premium AND tax benefits
- I get business tax deduction

This seems like the best of both worlds:
- **Lower base premium** (individual marketplace)
- **Tax-free reimbursement** (like group plan pre-tax benefit)
- **Company saves money** ($159/month vs $205/month)
- **Employee saves money** ($1,427/month vs $1,848/month)

Does this make sense to you? Have you worked with clients who've done this?

## 6. YOUR PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION

Given your 30+ years of experience in the NJ small business market, I value your honest opinion:

**For a 2-person company with very tight margins:**
- Would you recommend the small group plan at $2,053/month?
- Or would you recommend supporting the employee with individual marketplace insurance at $1,586/month (possibly via ICHRA)?

I understand you work for Northwestern Mutual and your quotes are for group insurance, but I'm asking for your candid professional advice - what would YOU do in my situation?

## 7. NEXT STEPS IF WE GO WITH SMALL GROUP

If the coverage advantages justify the $467/month premium difference, I'm open to moving forward with your AmeriHealth Silver EPO group plan. In that case, please provide:

1. Complete Summary of Benefits document
2. Provider network directory link
3. Application timeline to ensure November 1st coverage
4. Required documents for enrollment
5. Confirmation that Dr. Mary Lare is in-network

## 8. LIFE & DISABILITY INSURANCE

You mentioned you can help with life and disability insurance through Northwestern Mutual. I'm interested in exploring this for Rajesh, but let's get the health insurance finalized first. Can we discuss this after we have coverage in place?

## MY SITUATION

To be transparent about our budget constraints:

We're a small IT consulting firm with very tight margins. After payroll, workers comp, general liability, factoring fees, and other overhead, we have limited budget for benefits.

I want to provide health insurance for Rajesh, but:
- I can only afford 10% contribution
- The $205/month small group cost vs. $0-159/month for individual makes a meaningful difference to our cash flow
- The $5,600/year savings would help us grow and potentially add more employees

That's why I'm seriously considering the individual marketplace route, especially if I can set up ICHRA to provide tax benefits.

## REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION

Can you please:
1. ✅ Verify Dr. Mary Lare network status for AmeriHealth Silver EPO
2. ✅ Explain why small group costs $467/month more than individual for similar coverage
3. ✅ Give your honest professional opinion on individual vs small group for our situation
4. ✅ Confirm if you've seen other small businesses use ICHRA successfully
5. ✅ Provide timeline for enrollment if we choose your small group plan

## MY TIMELINE

I need to make a final decision by this Saturday (October 19) to ensure coverage starts November 1st. I'm comparing quotes from multiple sources and will choose the option that provides the best value for both the business and my employee.

I appreciate your time, expertise, and honesty. Your acknowledgment that "if bottom line premium is most important, go with the less expensive option" is the kind of straightforward advice I need.

Thank you,

P.S. - I'm not trying to avoid working with you or Northwestern Mutual. I'm genuinely trying to understand if the $5,600/year premium difference is justified by coverage advantages I'm not seeing. If you can explain why small group is worth the extra cost, I'm absolutely open to moving forward with your recommendation.
