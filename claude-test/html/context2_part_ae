- The US citizen child (Kevit) may be eligible for CHIP or subsidies
- Employee's estimated 2024 household income: $132,000

WHAT I'RE REQUESTING:
OPTION 1 - SMALL GROUP INSURANCE:
- Quote through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- Group coverage for employee + family (4 people)
- PPO or EPO plans from Horizon BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, AmeriHealth
- Show 10% employer contribution / 90% employee contribution

PREPARE FOR FRIDAY 3:15 PM CALL WITH ADRIANA
Have Ready: ✓ Rajesh's insurance form with all details ✓ Notepad to take notes ✓ Calculator (to compute costs in real-time) ✓ Questions list

Key Questions to Ask Adriana:

"Which option is cheaper overall - group or individual insurance for an H-1B family?"
"Does the US citizen child (1 year old) qualify for NJ FamilyCare/CHIP given the family income of $132K?"
"If we go with individual insurance, can we set up an ICHRA (Individual Coverage HRA) for reimbursement?"
"What's the timeline to get coverage effective November 1st for each option?"
"Is Dr. Mary Lare, DO in Basking Ridge in-network for the plans you're quoting?"
"For group insurance, are there any restrictions because the employee is on H-1B visa?"
"What's the application process and what documents do we need?"
ESTIMATED COSTS (For Your Planning)
Based on typical NJ rates for this family profile:

GROUP INSURANCE (Most Likely Option):
Carrier	Plan Type	Total Premium	Your Cost (10%)	Employee Cost (90%)
Horizon BCBS	PPO	$2,600/month	$260/month	$2,340/month
UnitedHealthcare	EPO	$2,200/month	$220/month	$1,980/month
AmeriHealth	PPO	$2,500/month	$250/month	$2,250/month
INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE (For Comparison):
Coverage	Premium	Subsidy	Net Cost
Family (3 H-1B + 1 US citizen)	$3,000/month	$0 (H-1B not eligible)	$3,000/month
US citizen child only (CHIP)	$50/month	Depends on income	$0-50/month
Likely conclusion: Group insurance will be $400-800/month cheaper than individual

NEXT WEEK'S DECISION PROCESS
Monday: Review all quotes received

Tuesday:

Compare costs side-by-side
Verify Dr. Mary Lare is in-network
Check if any issues with H-1B visa status
Wednesday:

Make decision on which carrier/plan
Talk to Rajesh about the cost-sharing (90% he pays)
Confirm he's okay with the arrangement
Thursday:

Submit application with chosen broker
Provide all required documents
Pay first month's premium
By October 24-25:

Application approved
Coverage confirmed for November 1st start
CRITICAL: TALK TO RAJESH THIS WEEKEND
You need to have an honest conversation with Rajesh about costs:

What to tell him:

"Rajesh, I've been working on getting us group health insurance through the company. Here's what I've found:

The Situation:

Group insurance will cost about $2,400/month for your family
New Jersey law requires I contribute at least 10%, which is about $240/month
Due to our tight margins (80/20 split with all our overhead), I can only afford the 10% minimum
That means you'll pay about $2,160/month for coverage
Why This is Still Good for You:

Individual insurance for H-1B families costs $3,000+ per month
So you're saving about $1,000/month by getting group rates
It's pre-tax deduction, saving you another $650/month in taxes
Total savings to you: about $1,650/month vs. buying individual insurance
Your Take-Home:

Current: $7,669/month after taxes
After health insurance: $5,509/month
This is tight, I know, but it's still better than the alternative
If Our Client Approves a Rate Increase:

I'm requesting a rate increase to $69-70/hour
If approved, I'll increase my contribution to 25-50%
This would reduce your cost by $360-960/month
Can you work with this arrangement for now?"

Let Rajesh decide if he wants the coverage at 90% employee contribution.

SUMMARY: YOU'RE DONE FOR TONIGHT!
What you accomplished: ✅ Contacted 20+ agents ✅ Got 4 solid responses ✅ Sent detailed information to 2 key agents ✅ Have call scheduled Friday 3:15 PM ✅ Should have multiple quotes by Monday

What's next:

Friday 3:15 PM call with Adriana
Receive quotes over the weekend
Compare options Monday
Make decision by Wednesday
Submit application Thursday
Timeline to coverage:

Application: Next week
Approval: ~5-7 days
Coverage effective: November 1st ✅
You've done excellent work today! Now relax for the evening. Tomorrow you'll take Adriana's call, and by Monday you'll have all the information you need to make a decision.

Great job! 🎉

Identified critical mismatch between individual marketplace plans and requested small group business coverage.
15s









IMPORTANT: Robert Knox sent you the WRONG type of insurance quotes!

Let me explain the problem and help you understand these numbers.

THE PROBLEM WITH THESE QUOTES
What you asked for: Small GROUP business insurance through Paragroup LLC

What Robert Knox sent: INDIVIDUAL marketplace insurance (Get Covered NJ)

These are completely different products!

CRITICAL ISSUE: THE PRICES ARE MISLEADING
Look at the quotes carefully. Every plan says "after $866.00 savings"

This means:

The prices shown INCLUDE subsidies for citizens/green card holders
Rajesh (H-1B visa) CANNOT get these subsidies
The REAL prices are $866/month HIGHER than shown
ACTUAL PRICES (Without Subsidies for H-1B)
Let me show you the REAL cost:

Bronze Plans (Cheapest):
Plan	Shown Price	ACTUAL Price (No Subsidy)
Oscar Bronze Classic	$564.65/month	$1,430.65/month
Horizon OMNIA Bronze	$637.98/month	$1,503.98/month
UHC Bronze Value	$695.44/month	$1,561.44/month
Silver Plans (Better Coverage):
Plan	Shown Price	ACTUAL Price (No Subsidy)
Aetna CVS Silver 2	$751.58/month	$1,617.58/month
AmeriHealth IHC Silver	$719.92/month	$1,585.92/month
Oscar Silver Classic	$836.30/month	$1,702.30/month
UHC Silver Advantage	$961.85/month	$1,827.85/month
DR. MARY LARE NETWORK STATUS
Good news from Robert Knox's research:

✅ Dr. Mary Lare ACCEPTS:

UnitedHealthcare (In-Network)
AmeriHealth (In-Network)
❌ Dr. Mary Lare DOES NOT ACCEPT:

Oscar
Horizon
Aetna CVS
So Rajesh can ONLY use UnitedHealthcare or AmeriHealth plans if he wants to keep Dr. Mary Lare.

WHY THESE QUOTES ARE WRONG FOR YOU
Individual marketplace insurance:

Rajesh buys it himself as an individual
No employer involvement
H-1B holders pay FULL price (no subsidies)
Cost: $1,400-1,800/month
You could reimburse him via ICHRA, but complex
Small group business insurance (what you need):

Company sponsors the plan
You contribute 10-25% as employer
Employee pays rest through payroll
Cost: Typically $2,200-2,600/month total
Better for business structure
Simpler administration
WHAT TO DO NOW
Option 1: Email Robert Knox Back (RECOMMENDED)
Subject: Need Small Group Business Insurance Quotes, Not Individual

Hi Robert,

Thank you for the plan comparisons. However, I notice these are individual marketplace plans from GetCoveredNJ.

I need SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE quotes through my company (Paragroup LLC), not individual marketplace insurance.

Can you provide:
1. Small group EPO/PPO quotes from UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth
2. Total premium for employee + family (4 people)
3. Based on 10% employer / 90% employee contribution split

If you don't handle small group insurance, please let me know and I'll work with another broker.

Employee details:
- Age 44, spouse age 32, children ages 9 and 1
- Location: Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
- H-1B visa family
- Must include Dr. Mary Lare, DO in network

Thank you,
Vinod
Option 2: Use Individual Plans (Only If You Can't Get Group)
If you CANNOT get small group insurance, here's the best individual option:

Best Choice: AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO

Actual cost: $1,585.92/month
Dr. Mary Lare: In-Network ✓
Deductible: $2,500 individual / $5,000 family
Out-of-pocket max: $9,000 individual / $18,000 family
Primary care: $25 copay
Specialist: $60 copay
How it would work:

Rajesh buys individual insurance: $1,585.92/month
You reimburse him via ICHRA: $240/month (10%)
Rajesh pays: $1,345.92/month
More complex paperwork and tax reporting
MY RECOMMENDATION
Do NOT use these individual plans.

Instead:

Email Robert Knox asking for SMALL GROUP quotes
Wait for Friday 3:15 PM call with Adriana Molina - ask her for SMALL GROUP quotes
Wait for Chuck Hackel's response - he should send SMALL GROUP quotes
By Monday, you should have:

Chuck Hackel: Small group quotes
Adriana Molina: Both small group AND individual quotes (for comparison)
Robert Knox: Hopefully small group quotes after your clarification
SMALL GROUP vs. INDIVIDUAL COMPARISON
For Rajesh's family of 4:

Type	Total Premium	Your Cost (10%)	Rajesh Cost (90%)	Better For
Small Group	~$2,400/month	~$240/month	~$2,160/month	Business structure, H-1B
Individual	~$1,586/month	$0-240/month	~$1,346-1,586/month	If group not available
Individual is cheaper by ~$800/month, but:

Less professional
More administrative burden
Harder for H-1B documentation
Not standard employer benefit
BOTTOM LINE
These quotes from Robert Knox are: ❌ Wrong product type (individual vs. group) ❌ Misleading pricing (includes subsidies Rajesh can't get) ✅ Helpful info about Dr. Mary Lare (UHC and AmeriHealth only)

Your next steps:

Email Robert Knox requesting SMALL GROUP quotes
Friday 3:15 PM: Ask Adriana for SMALL GROUP quotes
Wait for Chuck Hackel's SMALL GROUP quotes
Monday: Compare all small group options
Only consider individual plans if small group is impossible
Don't make any decisions based on these individual marketplace quotes. Wait for proper small group business insurance quotes from your agents.

Should I draft the email to Robert Knox requesting small group quotes?

Ah! My apologies - these quotes are from JOLLY LUTHRA, not Robert Knox!

Let me correct my response:

CRITICAL: JOLLY LUTHRA SENT THE WRONG TYPE OF INSURANCE
What you asked for: Small GROUP business insurance through Paragroup LLC

What Jolly Luthra sent: INDIVIDUAL marketplace insurance (GetCoveredNJ) with subsidies

These prices DON'T apply to Rajesh because he's H-1B!

THE SUBSIDY PROBLEM
Every plan shows "after $866.00 savings" - this is a subsidy that:

❌ H-1B visa holders CANNOT receive
❌ Makes all prices misleading
✅ Only applies to US citizens/green card holders
Real prices are $866/month HIGHER than shown!

ACTUAL PRICES (No Subsidies for H-1B)
Bronze Plans:
Plan	Shown Price	REAL Price for H-1B
Oscar Bronze Classic	$564.65/month	$1,430.65/month
Horizon OMNIA Bronze	$637.98/month	$1,503.98/month
UHC Bronze Value	$695.44/month	$1,561.44/month
Silver Plans:

Oscar Silver	$836.30/month	$1,702.30/month
UHC Silver	$961.85/month	$1,827.85/month
GOOD NEWS: DR. MARY LARE INFO
Jolly confirmed: ✅ Dr. Mary Lare ACCEPTS: UnitedHealthcare & AmeriHealth ❌ Dr. Mary Lare DOES NOT ACCEPT: Oscar, Horizon, Aetna

Only UHC or AmeriHealth plans will work for Rajesh.

Subject: RE: Health Insurance - Need Small Group Business Quotes

Hi Jolly,

Thank you for the plan information and for verifying Dr. Mary Lare's network status.

However, I notice these are individual marketplace plans from GetCoveredNJ with subsidies that my H-1B employee cannot receive. The actual cost would be $866/month higher than shown.

I need SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE quotes through my company (Paragroup LLC), not individual marketplace insurance.

Can you provide small group insurance quotes showing:
1. UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth EPO/PPO plans
2. Total monthly premium for employee + family (4 people)
3. 10% employer / 90% employee contribution split

COMPANY & EMPLOYEE DETAILS:
Company: Paragroup LLC

If you specialize in individual plans rather than small group business insurance, please let me know so I can work with a broker who handles small group.

ABOUT JOLLY LUTHRA / NEW YORK LIFE
Jolly Luthra works for:

Luthra Financial LLC
Affiliated with New York Life (securities through NYLIFE Securities)
May specialize in life insurance, financial services, individual policies
May NOT handle small group business health insurance
Many financial advisors don't handle small group health insurance - they focus on:

Life insurance
Investments
Annuities
Individual health insurance
This might be why he sent individual marketplace quotes instead of small group quotes.

AGENTS STATUS UPDATE
Agents who responded:

✅ Chuck Hackel (Northwestern Mutual) - You replied, waiting for his small group quotes
⏳ Robert Knox - Said he'd call before 5 PM today
⏳ Jose Sanchez - Will call back
✅ Adriana Molina - Friday 3:15 PM call scheduled, you already requested both group and individual quotes
❌ Jolly Luthra - Sent wrong product type (individual instead of group)
YOUR GAME PLAN
Today (Now):
Send email to Jolly Luthra asking for small group quotes (above)
Wait for Robert Knox's call (if he hasn't called yet)
Friday 3:15 PM:
Take call with Adriana Molina
She should have both group and individual quotes ready
Weekend/Monday:
Review small group quotes from Chuck Hackel
Review small group quotes from Adriana Molina
Possibly review small group quotes from Jolly (if he handles it)
Compare and decide
INDIVIDUAL vs. SMALL GROUP PRICING
Just so you understand the difference:

Individual marketplace insurance (what Jolly quoted):

Real cost for H-1B: ~$1,586/month (AmeriHealth Silver)
Rajesh buys it himself
You could reimburse $240/month (complex ICHRA setup)
Total cost to you: $240/month
Small group business insurance (what you need):

Estimated cost: ~$2,400/month total premium
Company sponsors the plan
You pay 10%: $240/month
Rajesh pays 90%: $2,160/month
Professional employer benefit
Better for H-1B documentation
Individual is ~$800/month cheaper total, but less professional and more administrative burden.

MY RECOMMENDATION
Email Jolly Luthra (using template above) to ask if he can quote small group
Expect he may say no - many New York Life affiliated advisors focus on life insurance and individual products, not small group health
Wait for your other 3 agents who are more likely to handle small group business insurance:
Chuck Hackel (Northwestern Mutual - does group health)
Adriana Molina (Friday call)
Robert Knox
If you can't get small group quotes, then consider using individual marketplace as backup option
Send that email to Jolly now, then wait for your Friday call with Adriana and quotes from Chuck. You should have proper small group options by Monday.

Would you like me to help you with anything else while you wait for responses?

When we look at the business prices that's going to be even higher than the individual prices right And why can't we reply jolly Lutra about the bronze plans what is shown in the pdfc centers and what will be the real price for H-1B similar for silver plans so that he knows it this is the total price that is going to be and which is really expensive so that he can confirm it saying that yes that is right then we can send that updated Information with the latest codes for H-1B related because when we look at it the individual plans they are little bit less surprise here than the group plans from the company so can we take a quote with out subsidies of H-1B because he is not eligible because of green card and citizenship so can we get a code for H-1B what is valid So that it will be clear by that way we know what is exactly the total price effecting on the quotes Can you phrase an email for this So that we can send it to Lutra Jolly


Analyzed individual versus group insurance pricing discrepancies for H-1B holders.








You're absolutely right! This is very smart thinking.

Individual marketplace insurance (even without subsidies) might actually be CHEAPER than small group business insurance. Let me draft an email to Jolly Luthra that:

Confirms the actual prices without subsidies for H-1B
Requests quotes that exclude subsidies
Asks for both individual AND small group quotes for comparison

Subject: RE: Health Insurance - Need Quotes Without Subsidies for H-1B Visa Holder

Hi Jolly,

Thank you for sending the plan comparisons and for verifying that Dr. Mary Lare accepts UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth.

I need to clarify an important detail about the pricing: My employee is on an H-1B visa and CANNOT receive premium tax credits or subsidies on the marketplace. His spouse is H-4 dependent and one child is also H-4. Only one child is a US citizen.

CLARIFICATION NEEDED:

The quotes you sent show prices "after $866.00 savings" which suggests a monthly subsidy of $866. Since my H-1B employee cannot receive subsidies, I need to confirm the ACTUAL prices:

BRONZE PLANS - What is the real price WITHOUT subsidies?
- Oscar Bronze Classic: Shows $564.65/month → Actual price $1,430.65/month?
- Horizon OMNIA Bronze: Shows $637.98/month → Actual price $1,503.98/month?
- UHC Bronze Value: Shows $695.44/month → Actual price $1,561.44/month?

SILVER PLANS - What is the real price WITHOUT subsidies?
- Aetna Silver 2 Advanced: Shows $751.58/month → Actual price $1,617.58/month?
- Oscar Silver Classic: Shows $836.30/month → Actual price $1,702.30/month?
- AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO: Shows $719.92/month → Actual price $1,585.92/month?
- UHC Silver Advantage: Shows $961.85/month → Actual price $1,827.85/month?

Can you please confirm these actual prices are correct for an H-1B visa holder with no subsidies?

ALSO REQUESTING: SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE QUOTES

I would also like to compare individual marketplace insurance with small group business insurance through my company to see which is more cost-effective.

Can you provide quotes for BOTH options:

OPTION 1: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE (No Subsidies for H-1B)
- UnitedHealthcare plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
- AmeriHealth plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
- Full price without any subsidies
- Family of 4: Employee (age 44, H-1B), Spouse (age 32, H-4), Children (ages 9 H-4, and 1 US citizen)

OPTION 2: SMALL GROUP BUSINESS INSURANCE
- Quote through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth EPO/PPO plans
- Same family of 4
- Show total premium with 10% employer / 90% employee split

IMPORTANT: Since the employee is H-1B visa, he is NOT eligible for premium tax credits or subsidies. Please provide quotes showing the full premium cost without any subsidies.

WHY I'M REQUESTING BOTH:
I want to compare which option is more cost-effective:
1. Individual marketplace insurance at full price (no subsidies)
2. Small group business insurance with 10% employer contribution

Based on the prices in your initial email, individual marketplace insurance WITHOUT subsidies might actually be less expensive than small group insurance, which is why I want to compare both options.

If you handle both types of insurance, please provide quotes for both. If you specialize in only individual or only small group, please let me know which you can assist with.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,

WHY THIS APPROACH IS SMART
You're right to question this! Here's the comparison:

INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE (No Subsidies)
Best option: AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO

Real cost: $1,585.92/month
Dr. Mary Lare: In-network ✓
Employee pays: $1,585.92/month
Company pays: $0 (or optional ICHRA reimbursement)
If you reimburse 10% via ICHRA:

Your cost: ~$159/month
Employee cost: ~$1,427/month
SMALL GROUP BUSINESS (Estimated)
Typical small group pricing:

Total premium: ~$2,400-2,600/month
Your cost (10%): ~$240-260/month
Employee cost (90%): ~$2,160-2,340/month
THE MATH: INDIVIDUAL IS CHEAPER!
Option 1: Individual Insurance (No Subsidies)

Who Pays	Amount
Total premium	$1,586/month
Company (0% contribution)	$0/month
Rajesh	$1,586/month
Option 2: Small Group Insurance

Who Pays	Amount
Total premium	$2,400/month
Company (10%)	$240/month
Rajesh (90%)	$2,160/month
Savings with individual insurance:

Company saves: $240/month = $2,880/year
Rajesh saves: $574/month = $6,888/year
Total savings: $814/month = $9,768/year
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
Why Individual Might Be Better:
✅ Much cheaper total cost ($814/month less)
✅ Rajesh saves significant money ($574/month)
✅ You save money ($240/month vs. $0)
✅ Same doctors (UHC or AmeriHealth work)
✅ Similar coverage levels

Why Small Group Might Be Better:
✅ More professional employer benefit
✅ Better for H-1B visa documentation
✅ Easier payroll deduction
✅ More standard business practice
✅ Potentially better coverage options

ICHRA OPTION (Middle Ground)
If you go with individual insurance, you could set up an ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement):

How it works:

Rajesh buys individual insurance: $1,586/month
You reimburse him tax-free: $159-240/month (10-15%)
Rajesh gets tax-free reimbursement
You get business tax deduction
Your cost: $159-240/month (vs. $240-260 for small group) Rajesh's cost: $1,346-1,427/month (vs. $2,160-2,340 for small group)

ICHRA is IRS-approved and legal for H-1B visa holders.

WHAT JOLLY WILL LIKELY CONFIRM
He'll probably confirm:

Individual prices WITHOUT subsidies are exactly as you calculated ($866 higher)
AmeriHealth Silver: $1,585.92/month actual price
UHC Silver: $1,827.85/month actual price
These are still cheaper than small group ($2,400+/month)
He might not handle small group insurance (many financial advisors don't), but at least you'll have confirmed individual pricing.

YOUR COMPLETE STRATEGY
Today:

✅ Send this email to Jolly Luthra
⏳ Wait for Robert Knox's call (if hasn't called yet)
Friday 3:15 PM: 3. ✅ Take call with Adriana Molina 4. Ask her for BOTH individual (no subsidies) AND small group quotes

This Weekend: 5. Review responses from all agents 6. Compare individual vs. small group pricing 7. Decide which is better

Monday: 8. Make final decision 9. Submit application

MY UPDATED RECOMMENDATION
Based on your smart thinking, here's what I now recommend:

If individual insurance is $800+/month cheaper:

✅ Go with individual marketplace insurance
✅ Set up ICHRA to reimburse Rajesh 10-15%
✅ Choose AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO ($1,586/month)
✅ Dr. Mary Lare is in-network
✅ Everyone saves significant money
Only choose small group if:

The price difference is smaller than expected
Rajesh strongly prefers employer-sponsored plan
You want more professional benefit structure
Send that email to Jolly right now. You're thinking about this very intelligently. Individual insurance without subsidies might be the best financial option for everyone!


Hi Vinod, For those companies, we’ll need to check whether they’re currently accepting a SHOP plan for just one employee. From what I can see, there shouldn’t be much difference between the Marketplace and a one-employee SHOP plan. If you already have options through another broker and need to m

CRITICAL: Adriana is asking a very important question that could change EVERYTHING!

She's asking: Is Rajesh's H-1B visa sponsored BY Paragroup LLC (your company)?

This is crucial because:

If YES: Rajesh MIGHT qualify for subsidies if your employer coverage is "unaffordable"
If NO: No subsidies available at all
Let me help you answer her correctly.

FIRST: ANSWER THIS QUESTION
Is Rajesh's H-1B visa sponsored by Paragroup LLC?

Scenario A: YES - Paragroup LLC sponsors Rajesh's H-1B
(Paragroup is his official employer on I-129/I-797)

Scenario B: NO - Another company sponsors Rajesh's H-1B
(He works for Paragroup but H-1B sponsored elsewhere)

Which scenario applies to you?

IF SCENARIO A (Paragroup sponsors H-1B):
IMPORTANT: Rajesh MIGHT qualify for subsidies!
The "Affordability" Rule:

If employee's share of group insurance > 9.12% of household income
Then employer coverage is "unaffordable"
H-1B employee CAN get marketplace subsidies
Rajesh's income: $132,000/year

9.12% = $12,038/year = $1,003/month
If group insurance costs Rajesh > $1,003/month:

Group coverage is "unaffordable"
Rajesh CAN get marketplace subsidies (~$866/month)
Individual marketplace becomes MUCH cheaper
Example:

Group insurance: $2,400/month total
Rajesh pays 90% = $2,160/month
Since $2,160 > $1,003 (unaffordable!)
Rajesh qualifies for $866/month subsidy
Individual insurance with subsidy: $720/month
Saves $1,440/month vs. group!
EMAIL RESPONSE TO ADRIANA (If Paragroup Sponsors H-1B)
Subject: RE: H-1B Visa Information - Paragroup LLC Sponsors Employee

Hi Adriana,

Thank you for the important question. Yes, Rajesh Kumar Gupta's H-1B visa is sponsored by Paragroup LLC. We are his official employer and H-1B sponsor.

Given this, I understand from your email that he might qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits if our employer-sponsored coverage is "unaffordable" (exceeds 9.12% of his household income).

AFFORDABILITY CALCULATION:
Rajesh's household income: $132,000/year
9.12% affordability threshold: $12,038/year = $1,003/month

Based on preliminary research, small group insurance would likely cost Rajesh approximately $2,160/month (90% of ~$2,400 total premium), which is well above the $1,003/month affordability threshold.

This would make employer-sponsored coverage "unaffordable" and qualify Rajesh for Marketplace premium tax credits.

REVISED REQUEST:
Given this information, please provide quotes for:

OPTION 1: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE WITH SUBSIDIES
- If employer coverage is unaffordable (employee cost > $1,003/month)
- Rajesh would qualify for premium tax credits
- Please show subsidized pricing for:
  - UnitedHealthcare plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
  - AmeriHealth plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)
  - Silver tier EPO plans

OPTION 2: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE WITHOUT SUBSIDIES
- Full price for comparison
- Same carriers and plan types

OPTION 3: SMALL GROUP / SHOP INSURANCE
- Through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- Total premium and 10% employer / 90% employee split
- UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth EPO plans

EMPLOYEE & FAMILY:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, H-1B (Paragroup sponsored)

Income: $132,000/year

QUESTION: Can you confirm whether small group coverage would be "unaffordable" under the ACA definition, thus making Rajesh eligible for Marketplace subsidies?

## EMAIL RESPONSE TO ADRIANA (If Paragroup Does NOT Sponsor H-1B)

**Subject:** RE: H-1B Visa Information - Not Sponsored by Paragroup LLC
```
Hi Adriana,

Thank you for the important question. To clarify: Rajesh Kumar Gupta's H-1B visa is NOT sponsored by Paragroup LLC. His H-1B is sponsored by [OTHER COMPANY NAME].

He works for Paragroup LLC as an employee/consultant, but we are not his H-1B sponsor.

Given this, I understand that:
- Rajesh cannot receive Marketplace premium tax credits
- H-4 dependents also cannot receive subsidies
- They can purchase Marketplace coverage at full price
- Only the US citizen child (Kevit) might qualify for CHIP

REVISED REQUEST:
Please provide quotes for:

OPTION 1: INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE (No Subsidies for H-1B)
- Full price without subsidies for family of 4
- UnitedHealthcare and AmeriHealth EPO plans
- Silver tier plans (Dr. Mary Lare in-network)

OPTION 2: SMALL GROUP / SHOP INSURANCE
- Through Paragroup LLC (EIN: 37-2028003)
- 10% employer / 90% employee contribution split
- Same carriers and plan types

OPTION 3: CHIP for US Citizen Child
- Can the US citizen child (age 1) qualify for NJ FamilyCare separately?
- Household income: $132,000

EMPLOYEE & FAMILY:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, H-1B (not Paragroup sponsored)
Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, H-4 dependent

Net savings: $334/month
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW
STEP 1: Determine if Paragroup LLC sponsors Rajesh's H-1B

Check his I-797 approval notice
Look at the "Petitioner" field
If it says "Paragroup LLC" → Scenario A
