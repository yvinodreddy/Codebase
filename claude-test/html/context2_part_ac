## VOICEMAIL SCRIPT (If No Answer)

"Hi, this is Vinod Yellagonda from Paragroup LLC in Somerset, New Jersey. My number is 732-986-3033.

I sent you an email yesterday about small business health insurance quotes for November 1st coverage. I'm following up by phone because of the tight timeline.

I need family coverage for one employee - PPO or EPO plans from Horizon, UnitedHealthcare, or AmeriHealth.

Could you please call me back at 732-986-3033, or email me at vinodyellagonda@paragroup.com?

I need quotes by end of this week. Thank you."
SUMMARY: WHAT TO BRING TO THE CALL
✓ Rajesh's insurance form (have it open)
✓ Notepad to write notes
✓ Your calendar
✓ Confidence - you have all the information you need!

KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER
Be confident - You're a business owner seeking quotes, this is routine for them
Don't apologize - You're not bothering them, this is their job
Take notes - Write down everything they promise
Get their direct contact - Phone and email
Follow up by email - Send details immediately after the call

You're ready! Pick up the phone and dial 732-302-1910 (Christopher Lester) right now.

Just read from this script. You've got this!

I think it's like 10 minutes before so do you want me to wait for some time


Pondered optimal timing for professional communication.







Good thinking! Yes, WAIT - timing matters for phone calls.

BEST TIMES TO CALL INSURANCE BROKERS
BEST TIMES (Highest Success Rate):
9:30 AM - 11:00 AM ✓ (Morning, fresh, not yet busy)
2:00 PM - 3:30 PM ✓ (After lunch, before end-of-day rush)
OKAY TIMES:
11:00 AM - 12:00 PM (May be heading to lunch)
1:00 PM - 2:00 PM (May be at lunch)
3:30 PM - 4:00 PM (Getting busier)
BAD TIMES (Avoid):
8:30 AM - 9:00 AM ❌ (Not settled in yet)
12:00 PM - 1:00 PM ❌ (Lunch time)
4:30 PM - 5:00 PM ❌ (Wrapping up, rushing out)
After 5:00 PM ❌ (Closed)
WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?
If it's currently:

Around 8:50 AM (10 min before 9 AM):
✓ WAIT until 9:15-9:30 AM - Let them settle in, check emails, get coffee. Call at 9:30 AM for best results.

Around 4:50 PM (10 min before 5 PM):
✓ WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING - Don't call now. They're wrapping up and won't give you proper attention. Call tomorrow at 9:30 AM instead.

Around 11:50 AM (10 min before noon):
✓ WAIT until 2:00 PM - They're probably heading to lunch soon. Call after lunch for better conversation.

MY RECOMMENDATION
Call tomorrow (Friday) morning at 9:30 AM.

Here's why this is actually BETTER:

Fresh start - They're alert and focused
Full day ahead - They have time to work on your quotes immediately
Not rushed - They'll give you their full attention
Can follow up same day - If they need more info, you're available all day
YOUR PLAN FOR TOMORROW MORNING
Tonight (prepare now):

Review the phone script I gave you
Have Rajesh's form open on your computer
Have notepad ready
Set alarm for 9:15 AM
Tomorrow morning:

9:15 AM - Review your notes one more time
9:30 AM - Call Christopher Lester: 732-302-1910
9:45 AM - Call Joe Kreinar: 732-207-7853
10:00 AM - Call Jose Sanchez: 800-828-4819
By 10:30 AM tomorrow, you'll have spoken to 3 agents and have quotes coming in by tomorrow afternoon or Monday.

USE THIS TIME TONIGHT TO PREPARE
Since you're waiting until tomorrow morning, use tonight to:

Print or save the phone script I gave you
Review Rajesh's form one more time
Write down your top 3 questions for the agents
Prepare your follow-up email template so it's ready to send immediately after each call
Get a good night's sleep - you'll be more confident on the phone
ONE MORE THING TO DO TONIGHT
Send a "heads up" email to the 3 agents you're calling tomorrow:

Subject: Will Call Tomorrow Morning - Health Insurance Quote Request Follow-Up

Email:

Hello,

I sent you an email earlier this week about small business health insurance quotes for Paragroup LLC.

I will be calling you tomorrow (Friday) morning to discuss this further, as we're working on a timeline to have coverage in place by November 1st.

If you have a preferred time for me to call, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll try reaching you around 9:30-10:00 AM.

Thank you,

Vinod Yellagonda
Paragroup LLC
(732) 986-3033
vinodyellagonda@paragroup.com
Send this to:

admin@professionalplanningservices.com
joekreinar@comcast.net
jsanchez@seniorhealthllc.com
This increases your chances that they'll be expecting your call and have time blocked for you.

You made the right call to wait. Tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM is perfect timing. Use tonight to prepare, and you'll crush those calls tomorrow!

Would you like me to create a simple checklist for you to use during tomorrow's calls?

Today I sent it almost 10 to 15 minutes before and now the time is 3:19 PM After 10:15 minutes can I give them a call and ask them about the insurance court is that going to look good


Strategized optimal timing for insurance agent call.
14s












YES! Call them RIGHT NOW at 3:30 PM - this is actually PERFECT timing!

WHY 3:30 PM IS GOOD
✓ Same-day follow-up - Shows you're serious and organized, not desperate ✓ Within the good window - 3:30 PM is still in the acceptable afternoon calling time ✓ Not too late - You're calling before they start wrapping up for the day (4:30+ PM) ✓ Professional - Email in the morning, call in the afternoon = perfect follow-up timing ✓ Gets them working over the weekend - If they get your info today (Friday), they can work on quotes over the weekend or first thing Monday

HOW TO OPEN THE CALL (Use This)
When they answer, say:

"Good afternoon, this is Vinod Yellagonda from Paragroup LLC. I sent you an email earlier today about small business health insurance quotes for November 1st. I wanted to follow up by phone since we're working on a tight timeline. Do you have a few minutes to discuss this?"
```

This is **perfect** because:
- You acknowledge the email (shows you're organized)
- You explain why you're calling (not just ignoring email, but timeline is important)
- You're polite and professional
- You ask if they have time (respectful of their schedule)

---

## WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW (Next 5 Minutes)

### **1. Get Ready (2 minutes):**
- Open Rajesh's insurance form on your computer
- Have a notepad and pen ready
- Have the phone script I gave you earlier open
- Take a deep breath - you've got this!

### **2. Make the calls (at 3:30 PM):**

**CALL #1: Christopher Lester - 732-302-1910**
- Call NOW at 3:30 PM
- Use the script
- If no answer, leave voicemail and move to next

**CALL #2: Joe Kreinar - 732-207-7853**
- Call immediately after first call
- Same approach

**CALL #3: Jose Sanchez - 800-828-4819**
- Call immediately after second call
- Same approach

---

## THIS TIMING LOOKS PROFESSIONAL, NOT DESPERATE

**How it looks to them:**
- 10:00 AM-ish: They receive your email
- 3:30 PM: You call to follow up

**What they think:**
✓ "This person is organized and serious"
✓ "They're following up professionally the same day"
✓ "This is a legitimate business inquiry"
✓ "They respect my time by emailing first then calling"

**What they DON'T think:**
❌ "This person is desperate"
❌ "This is spam"
❌ "They're bothering me"

Insurance brokers EXPECT and APPRECIATE follow-up calls. It shows you're a serious prospect, not just someone randomly sending emails.

---

## IF THEY ASK: "I just got your email a few hours ago..."

**Your response:**
```
"Yes, I know it's the same day - I'm following up quickly because we're on a tight timeline. My employee's coverage ends October 31st, so I need to have quotes and make a decision by early next week to ensure coverage starts November 1st. I wanted to make sure we connect while there's still time to get everything processed."
```

This explains your urgency **professionally** without sounding desperate.

---

## ADVANTAGE OF CALLING NOW (FRIDAY 3:30 PM)

**If you call now:**
- They have your info going into the weekend
- They can work on quotes Friday afternoon/evening
- You get quotes by Monday/Tuesday
- You make decision by Wednesday
- Application submitted by Thursday
- Coverage processed with 1+ week to spare

**If you wait until Monday:**
- They don't get your info until Monday
- Quotes by Tuesday/Wednesday
- Decision by Thursday/Friday
- Application submitted next week
- Very tight timeline (might miss November 1st)

**Call NOW = Extra 3 days of processing time**

**3:30 PM:** Call Christopher Lester (732-302-1910)
**3:40 PM:** Call Joe Kreinar (732-207-7853)

"The employee is on an H-1B visa, spouse is H-4 dependent, and one child is a US citizen born here. The other child is also on H-4."
```

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ASK ROBERT KNOX

When he's done asking you questions, ask him:

### **Question 1:**
```
"Can you quote me PPO plans from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, UnitedHealthcare, and AmeriHealth? I'd also like to see EPO options for cost comparison."
```

### **Question 2:**
```
"Can you verify that Dr. Mary Lare, DO in Basking Ridge is in-network for the plans you'll quote?"
```

### **Question 3:**
```
"When can I expect to receive the quotes? I'm hoping to make a decision by this weekend or early next week."
```

### **Question 4:**
```
"What's the timeline from when I submit an application to when coverage becomes effective? I need to make sure we can have coverage starting November 1st."
```

### **Question 5:**
```
"What's the latest I can submit an application and still have coverage effective November 1st?"

Unearthed alternative agent contacts for potential insurance quotes.






Great job making those calls! You now have 2 agents responding: ✓ Robert Knox (calling before 5 PM) ✓ Jose Sanchez (will call back)

That's actually pretty good, but I agree - let's get 2-3 more agents working on quotes so you have better options to compare.

Vinod, I received your quote request. Is the employee being insured the owner of the business or is the owner covered elsewhere and just this non owner employee needs coverage? The Affordable Care Act rules do not allow the owner of the business to be the only insured. Let me know

pasted

Hi got another reply from one of the vendors and I am attaching the document that he sent it to me can you check it and refresh an email so that what we should send to them


Decoded ACA insurance compliance for non-owner employee coverage.








Perfect! You got another response from Chuck Hackel from Northwestern Mutual. He's asking an important ACA compliance question.

Let me explain his question and draft the perfect response for you.

His Question: "Is the employee being insured the owner of the business, or is the owner covered elsewhere?"

Why he's asking: There's an Affordable Care Act (ACA) rule that says a business owner cannot be the ONLY person covered on a small group health plan. You need at least one non-owner employee to be covered for it to qualify as true "group" insurance.

Your situation (GOOD NEWS):

✓ Employee being insured: Rajesh Kumar Gupta (NON-owner employee)
✓ Owner: You (Vinod) - will NOT be covered
✓ This is 100% compliant with ACA rules
EMAIL RESPONSE TO CHUCK HACKEL
Subject: RE: Health Insurance Quote Request - Employee is Non-Owner

Email:

Hi Chuck,

Thank you for getting back to me so quickly and for clarifying the ACA requirements.

To answer your question: The employee being insured is NOT the owner of the business.

EMPLOYEE NEEDING COVERAGE:
Rajesh Kumar Gupta - Non-owner employee on H-1B visa

BUSINESS OWNER:
Vinod Yellagonda (me) - I am the owner and will NOT be covered under this plan

So this meets the ACA requirements - we have one non-owner employee with his family needing coverage, and the business owner (me) will not be insured under this group plan.

EMPLOYEE & FAMILY DETAILS:
Employee: Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, non-tobacco user
Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, non-tobacco user
Child 1: Hridhaan Gupta, DOB 04/16/2016
Child 2: Kevit Gupta, DOB 07/03/2024

Current Coverage: Anthem BCBS PPO ending October 31, 2025
New Coverage Needed: November 1, 2025

But we cannot use affordable care act and you are saying that if the company insurance is coming under the group plan so as a company owner you cannot be a part of that plan is that what you are trying to say


Decoded ACA group insurance rules for owner's coverage.






Let me clarify this - there's some confusion here. Let me explain the rule clearly:

THE ACA RULE EXPLAINED SIMPLY
What Chuck Hackel is checking:

The ACA rule says: You CANNOT have a small group health plan where the business OWNER is the ONLY person covered.

THREE SCENARIOS:
❌ SCENARIO 1: NOT ALLOWED

Only the owner (you) gets coverage
No other employees covered
This is NOT allowed under ACA rules
Insurance companies will reject this
✓ SCENARIO 2: ALLOWED

Owner (you) + Non-owner employee (Rajesh) both get coverage
This IS allowed
This is a legitimate group plan
✓ SCENARIO 3: ALLOWED (Your Current Situation)

Only non-owner employee (Rajesh) gets coverage
Owner (you) does NOT get coverage
This IS allowed
This is what you're doing right now
YOUR SITUATION (YOU'RE 100% COMPLIANT)
What you're doing:

Rajesh (non-owner employee) = Getting covered ✓
You (owner) = NOT getting covered ✓
Why this works:

You're covering a non-owner employee
The owner is not the only person being covered
This meets all ACA requirements
This is completely legal and allowed
CAN THE OWNER BE ON THE PLAN?
YES, the owner CAN be on the plan, BUT:

You need at least one non-owner employee also covered.

Example if you wanted coverage too:

Rajesh (employee) = Covered ✓
You (owner) = Covered ✓
This would be fine!
But in your case:

Rajesh (employee) = Covered ✓
You (owner) = Not covered ✓
This is also fine!
WHY CHUCK HACKEL ASKED THIS QUESTION
He's making sure you're not trying to do this:

❌ ILLEGAL scenario:

Owner only = Covered
No employees = Not covered
This would be rejected
✓ YOUR scenario (LEGAL):

Owner = Not covered
Employee = Covered
This is accepted
ALL SMALL GROUP PLANS USE ACA RULES
Important: ALL small group health insurance in the US must follow ACA (Affordable Care Act) rules. There's no way around this. Every plan from Horizon, UnitedHealthcare, AmeriHealth, etc. follows ACA rules.

ACA rules include: ✓ No pre-existing condition exclusions (good for you!) ✓ Coverage for H-1B visa holders (good for Rajesh!) ✓ Family coverage until age 26 ✓ Essential health benefits ✓ Owner cannot be the only person covered (the rule Chuck asked about)

THE EMAIL RESPONSE IS CORRECT
The email I drafted for Chuck Hackel correctly explains:

Rajesh (non-owner employee) is being covered
You (owner) are NOT being covered
This meets ACA requirements
This is the right answer to send him.

BOTTOM LINE
You're doing everything correctly!

Your setup:

✓ 2-person company
✓ Covering 1 non-owner employee (Rajesh)
✓ Owner (you) not getting coverage
✓ 100% ACA compliant
✓ Insurance companies will accept this
Chuck Hackel was just making sure you're not trying to get coverage ONLY for yourself as the owner, which wouldn't be allowed.

Your situation is completely legal and compliant. Send the email I drafted!

Does this make sense now? Your plan setup is perfect and follows all the rules. Chuck will give you quotes once you confirm that Rajesh is a non-owner employee.

So if I want to be get covered then I have to pay the price and it will be expensive all those things come into picture right


Analyzed owner's group plan coverage and cost implications.


YES, exactly! Let me break down your options clearly:

YOUR TWO OPTIONS
OPTION 1: Cover Only Rajesh (What You're Planning Now)
Who gets covered:

Rajesh + his family (spouse + 2 kids)
Estimated monthly cost:

Total premium: ~$2,400/month (estimated)
Your contribution (25%): ~$600/month
Rajesh pays: ~$1,800/month
Your monthly cost: $600

Pros: ✓ Affordable for your business ✓ Still provides benefit to Rajesh ✓ Meets your legal requirements ✓ You can afford this with your margins

OPTION 2: Cover Rajesh AND Yourself (Owner)
Who gets covered:

Rajesh + his family (4 people)
You + your family (if you have spouse/kids - how many?)
Estimated monthly cost:

Rajesh's family: ~$2,400/month
Your family: ~$2,400/month (if similar size)
Total: ~$4,800/month
If you contribute 50%:

Your cost: ~$2,400/month
Rajesh pays: ~$1,200/month
Your monthly cost: $2,400

Pros: ✓ You get health insurance too ✓ Better employee benefit

Cons: ❌ Very expensive - $2,400/month for you ❌ Based on your earlier financials, you only have ~$900/month net profit ❌ You cannot afford this - you'd be losing $1,500/month

BASED ON YOUR BUSINESS FINANCIALS
Remember your situation from earlier:

Your monthly gross margin: ~$2,284 Your current overhead:

TCI insurance: $870
Factoring fees: $237
Workers comp: ~$150-200
General liability: ~$100-150 Total overhead: ~$1,357 Net before health insurance: ~$927/month
If you add yourself to the plan:

Net: $927/month
Health insurance for both: -$2,400/month
You'd be losing $1,473/month
This would bankrupt your business.

MY RECOMMENDATION
Cover only Rajesh, NOT yourself.

Why:

You can't afford it - $2,400/month is more than your entire net profit
Rajesh needs it more - H-1B holders can't get marketplace subsidies
You have other options - As a US citizen/business owner, you can:
Buy individual insurance on the marketplace (GetCoveredNJ)
Potentially qualify for subsidies based on your income
Get coverage through a spouse if married
Go without for now and use the money to grow the business
YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR OWN COVERAGE
If you need health insurance for yourself:

Option A: Individual Marketplace (GetCoveredNJ)
Go to GetCoveredNJ.com
Shop for individual/family plans
May qualify for tax credits/subsidies
Typical cost: $400-800/month (with subsidies, could be less)
You pay this personally, not through the business
Option B: Spouse's Coverage
If you're married and spouse has employer coverage
Get covered through their plan
Option C: Wait Until Business Grows
Cover just Rajesh now
When revenue increases, add yourself later
Revisit in 6-12 months when margins improve
WHAT RATES WOULD BE IF YOU ADDED YOURSELF
Let me be clear about pricing:

The rate per person doesn't change - group insurance pricing is based on:

Age
Location
Tobacco use
Plan type
Example pricing:

44-year-old male (Rajesh): ~$600/month
32-year-old female (spouse): ~$450/month
9-year-old child: ~$200/month
1-year-old child: ~$150/month Total for Rajesh's family: ~$1,400/month
If you're 35 years old (example):

You: ~$500/month
Your spouse (if applicable): ~$450/month
Your kids (if applicable): ~$200 each Add another $1,400-2,400/month
