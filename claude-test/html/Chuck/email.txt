Hi Chuck,

Thank you for the comprehensive quotes! I really appreciate the detailed breakdown of the 7 plan options.

I have a few questions before moving forward:

1. DR. MARY LARE NETWORK STATUS:
You mentioned Dr. Mary Lare's office shows as "permanently closed" in your system. However, my employee has been seeing her recently at:

Dr. Mary Catherine Lare, DO
18 Lyons Rd, Suite 101
Basking Ridge, NJ 07920
Phone: 973-379-2111

Can you verify her network status with AmeriHealth and UnitedHealthcare Oxford? She may have moved offices or the database might be outdated. This is a critical requirement for us.

2. COST COMPARISON QUESTION:
I've been comparing small group insurance with individual marketplace insurance (purchased outside of the company).

For an H-1B visa holder who doesn't qualify for subsidies, individual marketplace insurance appears to be significantly less expensive:
- Individual marketplace: ~$1,586/month (AmeriHealth Silver, no subsidies)
- Small group: $2,053/month (AmeriHealth Silver from your quote)
- Difference: $467/month = $5,604/year savings

Can you help me understand:
- Why is small group insurance more expensive than individual insurance for the same carrier/plan?
- Are there advantages to small group that justify the higher cost?
- Would you recommend small group or supporting the employee with individual marketplace insurance?

3. PLAN DETAILS:
For the two most cost-effective options (AmeriHealth Silver EPO and UHC Oxford Metro EPO), can you provide:
- Summary of Benefits documents
- Detailed network information
- Application timeline to ensure November 1st coverage

4. H-1B VISA CONSIDERATIONS:
Are there any special considerations or restrictions for H-1B visa holders with small group insurance that I should know about?

EMPLOYEE DETAILS (for reference):
- Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, H-1B visa
- Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, H-4 visa
- Children: DOB 04/16/2016 (H-4), DOB 07/03/2024 (US citizen)
- Location: Basking Ridge, NJ 07920

I want to make the best decision for both the business and my employee. Your 30+ years of experience in the NJ small business market is invaluable, so I'd appreciate your honest guidance on whether small group or supporting individual marketplace insurance makes more sense in this situation.

Thank you,

Subject: RE: Small Business Health Insurance Quote Request - Somerset NJ {Secure Message}
 
Good morning Vinod,

 

Attached are quotes of the most popular plans.  There are lower cost plans available but that means higher deductibles and copays.

 

I tried to look up Dr Lare but it shows that her office is permanently closed.  Towards the top of each quote you can click on the view pdf tab for more details of each plan and to access the network of doctors and hospitals for each carrier.

 

If you get 100 quotes from 100 different agents, it all has to be the same rates.  The rates are all the same from one agent to another.  I have been in the small business market in NJ for over 30 years.  If your employee is also looking for life and disability insurance I can help him with this coverage as well.  I would use Northwestern Mutual for this portion of his coverage.  Northwestern has the best reputation and financial ratings in the industry.

 

Take a look and let me know your feedback,

Hi Chuck,

 

Thank you for your response. To answer your question: The employee being insured (Rajesh Kumar Gupta) is a non-owner employee, not the business owner. I (Vinod) am the owner and will not be covered under this plan, so this meets ACA requirements.

 

However, I need to be transparent about our budget constraints. We are a small consulting firm with very tight margins. We can commit to the New Jersey minimum requirement of 10% employer contribution, with the employee paying 90% of the premium.

 

Given this structure, can you please provide quotes showing:

1. Total monthly premium for employee + family

2. Cost breakdown: 10% employer / 90% employee

3. Options at different coverage levels (to help keep costs manageable)

 

I want to offer health insurance to my employee, but need to ensure it works within our business model.

 

Employee details:

- Rajesh Kumar Gupta, DOB 06/21/1981, non-tobacco

- Spouse: Sonali Kiran, DOB 11/11/1992, non-tobacco

- Child 1: DOB 04/16/2016

- Child 2: DOB 07/03/2024

- Location: Basking Ridge, NJ 07920

- Coverage start: November 1, 2025

 

Please let me know if you can work with a 10% employer contribution, or if you have alternative suggestions.

 

Thank you,

Vinod,

 

I received your quote request.  Is the employee being insured the owner of the business or is the owner covered elsewhere and just this non owner employee needs coverage?  The Affordable Care Act rules do not allow the owner of the business to be the only insured.

 

Let me know and I can have quotes to you within 24 hours,
