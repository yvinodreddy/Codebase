## 💬 CALL SCRIPT (Opening)

"Hi Adriana, thank you for scheduling this call. I've reviewed the affordability rule and have some important information about Rajesh's eligibility for marketplace subsidies.

Paragroup LLC sponsors Rajesh's H-1B visa. We received small group insurance quotes, and his share would be $1,848 per month for family coverage. Since this exceeds the 9.12% affordability threshold of $1,003 per month based on his $132,000 income, I believe he qualifies for premium tax credits on the marketplace.

Can you confirm this, and provide an official quote for the AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO plan with the subsidy applied?"

---

## 💬 CALL SCRIPT (Closing)

"Thank you for clarifying the subsidy eligibility. To summarize:
- Rajesh qualifies for $___/month subsidy ✅
- AmeriHealth IHC Silver EPO costs $___/month after subsidy ✅
- We need to complete enrollment by ________ ✅
- Documents needed: _____________ ✅

Can you email me the official quote and enrollment instructions today? We'll start the process immediately to ensure November 1st coverage.

Also, please include information about Dr. Mary Lare's network status and ICHRA setup if we decide to add that.

Thank you for your help!"
