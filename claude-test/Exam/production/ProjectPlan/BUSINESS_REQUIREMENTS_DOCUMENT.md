## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: LLM API Costs Too High**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Could make platform unprofitable
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Use smaller models (GPT-4-mini, Claude 3.5 Haiku) when possible
  2. Cache common responses (reduce API calls by 40%)
  3. Offer tiered pricing (basic = no LLM, premium = full LLM features)
  4. Self-host open-source LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral) for cost reduction

**Risk 2: AI Detection Accuracy < 99%**
- **Impact:** HIGH - False positives hurt candidate experience
- **Probability:** LOW
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Multi-model detection (GPT Zero + Copyleaks + custom model)
  2. Continuous model training on latest AI outputs
  3. Human review for borderline cases (80-90% AI probability)
  4. Candidate appeal process

**Risk 3: Real-Time AI Processing Lag**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Poor candidate experience if slow
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Use edge computing for video processing
  2. Optimize models for latency (quantization, pruning)
  3. Batch processing for non-critical features
  4. Fallback to asynchronous processing if real-time fails

### Business Risks

**Risk 4: Competitors Release Similar Features**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Lose differentiation
- **Probability:** HIGH (especially Talview Alvy expansion)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Move fast - implement Phase 1-2 within 12 months
  2. Continuous innovation (stay ahead of competitors)
  3. Build moats (proprietary data, custom models, partnerships)
  4. Focus on superior implementation, not just feature parity

**Risk 5: Universities Don't Adopt**
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Can't generate revenue
- **Probability:** LOW (if FERPA/GDPR compliant)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Pilot programs with 5-10 universities (free/discounted)
  2. Case studies and testimonials
  3. Compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
  4. LMS integration (Canvas, Moodle)

**Risk 6: High Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Reduces profitability
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Inbound marketing (content, SEO, webinars)
  2. Freemium model (free tier to attract users)
  3. Referral program (existing customers refer new ones)
  4. Partner with LMS providers (built-in distribution)

### Legal/Compliance Risks

**Risk 7: GDPR/FERPA Violation**
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Fines, lawsuits, reputation damage
- **Probability:** LOW (if properly implemented)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Hire experienced GDPR/FERPA lawyer ($15K-$25K)
  2. Annual compliance audits
  3. Insurance (cyber liability, errors & omissions)
  4. Staff training on data protection

**Risk 8: Bias in AI Algorithms**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Discrimination lawsuits, reputation damage
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (inherent in ML models)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Fairness testing (test AI on diverse populations)
  2. Bias monitoring dashboard (track outcomes by demographics)
  3. Human review for high-stakes decisions
  4. Transparent AI (explain why AI made decision)
