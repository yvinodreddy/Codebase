# 🚨 EXECUTE THIS NOW - GET UNBLOCKED IN 15 MINUTES

## YOUR SITUATION
- Blocked until Friday (5 days) on Claude Opus quota
- Healthcare GNN project needs Opus-level reasoning

- **SOLUTION: API = Unlimited Opus access**

---

## STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### STEP 1: Get API Key (5 minutes) ⏰

**Open browser NOW:**
```
https://console.anthropic.com
```

**Do this:**
1. Sign up / Log in
2. Left sidebar → Click "Get API Keys"
3. Click "Create Key" button
4. **COPY THE ENTIRE KEY** (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

**Keep this window open!**

You get $5-10 free credits to start. Add payment method after if needed.

---

### STEP 2: Run Setup Script (10 minutes) ⏰

**In your terminal (where you are RIGHT NOW), run:**

```bash
cd /home/user01/claude-test/ClaudeOpus
bash WSL2_OPUS_SETUP.sh
```

**The script will:**
1. Install Python dependencies
2. **ASK FOR YOUR API KEY** - Paste it when prompted
3. Save key to ~/.bashrc (automatic)
4. Create 3 helper tools in ~/opus_tools/
5. Test your connection automatically

**Just follow the prompts!**

---

### STEP 3: Test It Works (2 minutes) ⏰

**After setup completes, run:**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # Reload environment
python3 ~/opus_tools/test_opus.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
🤖 Response: Opus 4.1 is ready!
✅ SUCCESS! Opus 4.1 is working via API!
```

**If you see this = YOU'RE UNBLOCKED!**

---

### STEP 4: Start Using It NOW (Immediately) 🚀

**For your healthcare GNN project:**

```bash
python3 ~/opus_tools/healthcare_opus.py "Design the complete architecture for my healthcare dashboard with GNN + FHIR + LLM + multi-patient selection"
```

**This uses CACHED prompts = 90% cost savings automatically!**
- First query: ~$0.30 (creates cache)
- Next queries: ~$0.03 each (within 5 minutes)

**For general questions:**

```bash
# Quick question
python3 ~/opus_tools/opus_chat.py "Your question here"

# Interactive chat (like Claude Code)
python3 ~/opus_tools/opus_chat.py -i
```

---

## COST REALITY CHECK

### Your Situation:
- **Current:** Blocked for 5 days, $0 productivity
- **With API:** Unlimited Opus, pay per use

### Expected Costs:
- **Today (testing):** $0 (free credits)
- **This week (heavy use):** $5-10 total
- **Per month (with optimization):** $10-30 total

### Cost Per Query:
- Complex architecture query: $0.10 - $0.30
- With caching (2nd+ queries): $0.02 - $0.05
- **Value of being unblocked: PRICELESS**

---

## WHAT YOU GET

✅ **Unlimited Opus 4.1 access** (no weekly limits)
✅ **Same quality as Claude Code**
✅ **Work continues immediately**
✅ **Never blocked again**
✅ **90% cost savings with caching**
✅ **Keep your $100 Max plan for Claude Code**

**Total cost: $110-130/month for TRUE unlimited access**

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Problem: Script asks for API key but you don't have it yet
**Solution:** Press Ctrl+C, get your key from console.anthropic.com, then run script again

### Problem: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set" error
**Solution:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Problem: Python/pip not found
**Solution:** Script will auto-install, but you may need to approve with 'y'

### Problem: Import error for anthropic
**Solution:**
```bash
pip3 install --user anthropic
```

### Problem: Free credits exhausted
**Solution:** Add payment method at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing

---

## AFTER YOU'RE UNBLOCKED

### Set Billing Alert (5 minutes - do this today)
```
https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing

```
