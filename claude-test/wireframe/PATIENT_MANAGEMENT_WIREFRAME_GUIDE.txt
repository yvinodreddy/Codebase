SECTION 9: TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ
================================================================================

Q: Which tool should I use if I can't draw well?
A: Use Figma with pre-made components. No drawing needed!

Q: Can React developers really use these wireframes?
A: Yes! Figma's inspect mode gives exact CSS/React code.

Q: What if I need more than 3 projects in Figma?
A: Create multiple free accounts OR use Penpot (unlimited).

Q: How do I make wireframes responsive (mobile + desktop)?
A: Design multiple frames for each screen size in Figma.

Q: Can I collaborate with my team in real-time?
A: Yes! Figma, Penpot, Excalidraw, and Miro all support real-time collaboration.

Q: What format should I export for developers?
A: Share live link (best) OR export PNG (simple) OR use Anima for React code.

Q: How detailed should wireframes be?
A: Low-fidelity = boxes and labels (quick)
   High-fidelity = colors, real text, interactions (production-ready)
   Choose based on your timeline.
