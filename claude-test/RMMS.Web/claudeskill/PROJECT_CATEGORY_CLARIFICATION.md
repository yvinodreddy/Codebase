❌ **Machine Learning System** (optional ML is traditional only)

### Category Label:
**"AI-Assisted .NET Code Generation Tool"**

The skills use AI (Claude) to generate standard .NET business applications. The "AI" is in the CREATION process (Claude generates code), not in the CREATED product (which is a standard business app).

**If someone asks**: "Is this AI-Generative?"
**Answer**: "Yes, it's an AI-assisted code generation tool that uses Claude to generate .NET applications. The 'AI' refers to how the code is created, not what the code does."
