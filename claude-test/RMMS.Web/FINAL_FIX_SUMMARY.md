# FINAL FIX - Making All Pages Work

## Strategy
Since some repositories already exist (Paddy, RiceSales) and stored procedures are created, I just need to:

1. ✅ Update Program.cs with repository registrations (DONE)
2. ⏳ Update remaining services to use database (IN PROGRESS)
3. ⏳ Create missing repositories as needed
4. ⏳ Restart and test

## Current Status:
- ✅ ByProductSales - Working
- ✅ ExternalRiceSales - Working
- ✅ PaddyProcurement - Has repository (need to verify service)
- ✅ RiceSales - Has repository (need to verify service)
- ⏳ BankTransactions - Need to check/fix
- ⏳ CashBook - Need to check/fix
- ⏳ Others - Creating now...

## Quick Win Approach:
Let me restart app NOW with current fixes and see which pages work, then fix the rest.
