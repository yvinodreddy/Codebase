**Purpose**: **Ultra-aggressive 30-day sprint plan** (zero to production in 1 month)
**Key Sections**:
- **30-day timeline**: 4 weeks, 7-day-by-day breakdown
  - **Week 1 (Day 1-7)**: Foundation Blitz (infrastructure, team, Neo4j ontologies)
  - **Week 2 (Day 8-14)**: Parallel Development (RAG Heat + SWARMCARE MVPs)
  - **Week 3 (Day 15-21)**: Integration, Testing, Validation (doctor + lawyer sign-off)
  - **Week 4 (Day 22-30)**: Production Polish, Demo, Success!
- **Day-by-day execution plan** (what happens each day, hour-by-hour for critical days)
- **Work intensity**: 60-80 hours/week (sustainable for 4 weeks)
- **Critical success factors**: What must go right for 30-day success
- **Risk mitigation**: 30-day-specific risks and mitigations

- **Requires team commitment** (all 22 members agree to extended hours)
- **Demo-driven execution** (everything optimized for Day 29-30 demo)

**⚠️ Warning**: This is AGGRESSIVE. Only use if:
1. Team commits to 60-80 hour weeks (sustainable for 4 weeks, not long-term)
2. You're willing to accept technical debt (refactor in Month 2)
3. MVP is acceptable (not full-featured v1)
4. You have a hard deadline (demo to Jaideep, funding deadline, etc.)

**✅ Benefit**: You'll have 2 production-ready MVPs in 30 days (RAG Heat + SWARMCARE, integrated, HIPAA-compliant, doctor-validated, demo-ready)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Team Member Not Performing

**Symptoms**: Consistently missing sprint commitments, low-quality code, not attending meetings
**Solutions**:
1. 1:1 conversation (Project Director or Tech Lead) - understand root cause (personal issues, skill gap, burnout?)
2. If skill gap: Provide training, pair with senior engineer, reduce complexity of tasks
3. If personal issues: Offer flexibility, reduce workload temporarily, show empathy
4. If attitude/effort: Performance improvement plan (2-week trial), then termination if no improvement
5. **Reference Document 6** (Performance Metrics) for evaluation criteria

---

### Issue: Neo4j Ontology Loading Delays

**Symptoms**: Data Engineers unable to load all 13 ontologies by Week 4 (28-week) or Day 5 (30-day)
**Solutions**:
1. Prioritize critical ontologies (SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, RxNorm - top 5) over less critical
2. Hire external Neo4j consultant (contract basis, 1-2 weeks)
3. Use pre-processed ontology datasets (if available from Neo4j community, GitHub)
4. Parallel loading (multiple Data Engineers working on different ontologies simultaneously)
5. **Reference Document 4** (Technical Architecture) for Neo4j setup guidance

---

### Issue: Jaideep Not Responding to Outreach

**Symptoms**: 3+ emails sent, no response from Jaideep
**Solutions**:
1. Warm intro (ask advisory board, mutual connections for intro to Jaideep)
2. Multi-channel outreach (LinkedIn, email, phone if available)
3. UHG alternative contacts (reach out to UHG Innovation team, CTO, Chief Medical Officer)
4. Backup healthcare partners (5-7 other health systems, insurers, pharma companies)
5. Pivot strategy (direct-to-consumer, research platform) if UHG doesn't work out
6. **Reference Document 5** (Advisory Board & Stakeholder Engagement) for alternative strategies

---

### Issue: HIPAA Audit Failures

**Symptoms**: Lawyer identifies critical HIPAA gaps during Week 3 (30-day) or Week 19 (28-week) audit
**Solutions**:
1. Immediate triage: Categorize gaps (critical, high, medium, low)
2. Fix critical gaps within 48 hours (all hands on deck if needed)
3. External HIPAA consultant (if lawyer overwhelmed or gaps too complex)
4. Delay demo if necessary (better to delay than demo non-compliant system)
5. Document all fixes (for future audits and compliance records)
6. **Reference Document 8** (Risk Management & Compliance) for HIPAA framework

---

### Issue: Team Burnout (30-Day Sprint)

**Symptoms**: Team morale <3/5, complaints about work hours, increased bugs/errors, team members calling in sick
**Solutions**:
1. **Immediate action**: Mandatory rest day (entire team takes 1 day off)
2. Reduce hours (shift from 80 hours/week to 60 hours/week)
3. Extend timeline (30 days → 40 days, still better than 28 weeks)
4. Improve morale: Pizza/food delivery, public recognition, shoutouts, virtual hangouts
5. Re-evaluate feasibility: Is 30-day timeline realistic? Consider pivoting to 8-week "fast track" (middle ground)
6. **Reference Document 9** (Communication & Collaboration) for morale best practices
