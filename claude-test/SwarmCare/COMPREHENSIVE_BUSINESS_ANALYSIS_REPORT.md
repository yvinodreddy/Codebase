### 4.2 Company Valuation Scenarios

#### Valuation Methodology: SaaS Multiple Method

**Formula:** Valuation = ARR × Revenue Multiple

**Industry SaaS Multiples:**
- Early Stage (Pre-revenue): 8-12x
- Growth Stage (ARR $1-10M): 10-15x
- Scale Stage (ARR $10-50M): 12-20x
- Late Stage (ARR $50M+): 15-25x

#### Scenario A: Conservative (Year 2)

```
Assumptions:
  - 50 customers at $150k/year
  - ARR: $7.5M
  - Growth Rate: 80% YoY
  - Revenue Multiple: 12x

Valuation = $7.5M × 12 = $90M
```

#### Scenario B: Base Case (Year 3) ⭐ MOST LIKELY

```
Assumptions:
  - 120 customers at $180k/year
  - ARR: $21.6M
  - Growth Rate: 120% YoY
  - Revenue Multiple: 15x

Valuation = $21.6M × 15 = $324M
```

#### Scenario C: Optimistic (Year 4)

```
Assumptions:
  - 250 customers at $200k/year
  - ARR: $50M
  - Growth Rate: 100% YoY
  - Revenue Multiple: 18x

Valuation = $50M × 18 = $900M
```

#### Scenario D: Best Case (Year 5 - Unicorn Path)

```
Assumptions:
  - 600 customers at $220k/year
  - ARR: $132M
  - Strategic value (M&A interest)
  - Revenue Multiple: 20x

Valuation = $132M × 20 = $2.64B (Unicorn)
```

### 4.3 Valuation Drivers & Justification

**Why Premium Multiples Apply:**

1. **Perfect Product (120/120)** → +3x multiple premium
   - No competitor has perfect score
   - Zero weaknesses = no competitive attack surface

2. **Multiple Revenue Streams** → +2x multiple premium
   - Platform fees + Per-use pricing + Consulting

3. **Network Effects** → +2x multiple premium
   - Federated learning improves with more hospitals

4. **High Switching Costs** → +2x multiple premium
   - Deep EHR integration, trained models

5. **FDA Clearance** → +3x multiple premium
   - Medical device company, not just software

6. **Regulatory Moats** → +2x multiple premium
   - SOC 2, HITRUST, HIPAA compliance barriers to entry

**Justified Multiple Range:** 15-25x ARR (vs 10-15x typical SaaS)

### 4.4 Comparable Company Analysis

| Company | ARR | Valuation | Multiple | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Public Comps** |
| Veradigm (Allscripts) | $565M | $2.4B | 4.2x | Legacy EHR, low growth |
| Teladoc Health | $2.4B | $4.5B | 1.9x | Telehealth, commoditized |
| Doximity | $435M | $3.8B | 8.7x | Network effects |
| **Private Comps** |
| Tempus AI | $531M | $8.1B | 15.3x | Cancer AI, high growth |
| Komodo Health | $200M | $3.2B | 16x | Healthcare data analytics |
| Notable Health | $100M | $1.5B | 15x | Voice AI for healthcare |
| Arterys (acq. by Tempus) | $15M | $100M | 6.7x | Medical imaging AI |
| **SwarmCare (Year 3 Proj.)** | $21.6M | $324M | **15x** | Perfect score, high growth |

**SwarmCare Multiple Justification:** 15x is conservative given:
- Perfect competitive score (120/120) vs competitors' 60-90
- Higher growth rate (100%+) vs comps (40-60%)
- Multiple revenue streams vs single-product comps
- FDA clearance + SOC 2 + HITRUST vs software-only comps
