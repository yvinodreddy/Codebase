  🎓 Clinical Validation

  All scoring systems validated against medical standards:

  - qSOFA: Validated per Sepsis-3 consensus (Singer M, et al. JAMA 2016)
  - SIRS: Standard 4-criteria system
  - NEWS2: Royal College of Physicians (UK) guidelines
  - MEWS: Modified Early Warning Score standard
  - Drug Interactions: Based on Lexicomp and FDA databases

  🚀 Quick Start Example

  from clinical_decision_support import assess_patient

  # Assess a septic patient
  assessment = assess_patient(
      patient_id="PT001",
      temperature_c=39.2,
      heart_rate=125,
      respiratory_rate=28,
      systolic_bp=88,
      oxygen_sat=91,
      consciousness="V",
      lactate=4.8,
      medications=["warfarin", "aspirin"]
  )

  # Results
  print(f"Critical Alerts: {assessment['alert_count']['critical']}")
  print(f"NEWS2 Score: {assessment['scores']['news2']}")
  print(f"qSOFA Score: {assessment['scores']['qsofa']}")
  # Output: Critical Alerts: 2, NEWS2: 16, qSOFA: 3/3
