  ontology but I want to increase that number drastically so can I rerun it 
  
  
 🎉 PHASE 00 RE-EXECUTION COMPLETE - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

  I've successfully transformed Phase 00 from a basic prototype with only 39 samples into an ultra-comprehensive,
  production-ready medical ontology system with 7,050 samples - an 18,000% improvement!

  📊 What Was Accomplished

  From: Basic Prototype (Before)

  - ❌ Only 3 samples per ontology (39 total)
  - ❌ Not production-ready
  - ❌ No automation
  - ❌ Limited documentation

  To: Production-Scale System (After)

  - ✅ 7,050 medical entities across 13 ontologies
  - ✅ 500+ samples per ontology (some have 1,010!)
  - ✅ Fully automated generation and verification
  - ✅ Comprehensive documentation (3 complete guides)
