  🔁 Reusable for All 29 Phases

  This exact structure can be replicated for phases 1-28:

  # Copy to new phase
  cp -r phases/phase00/standalone_testing/ phases/phase{N}/standalone_testing/

  # Update config (PHASE_NUMBER, PORT)
  # Customize requirements
  # Run
  cd phases/phase{N}/standalone_testing/deployment
  ./run.sh

  Each phase gets its own:
  - Testing UI on port 8000+N
  - User story management
  - Phase-specific tracker
  - Documentation sync
  - Code generation
