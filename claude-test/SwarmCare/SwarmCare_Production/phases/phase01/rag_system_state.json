First-line treatment typically involves metformin, along with\n            lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise. Blood glucose monitoring is essential for\n            optimal management. Hemoglobin A1c should be measured every 3-6 months. Complications can include\n            diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Regular screening is recommended for all patients.\n            ",
