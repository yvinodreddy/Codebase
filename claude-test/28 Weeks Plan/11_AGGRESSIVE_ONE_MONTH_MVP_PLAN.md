**Note**: This is aggressive but achievable for a 30-day sprint. Post-30-day, return to normal 40-50 hour weeks.

---

### Team Allocation by Week

**Week 1: Foundation**
- **All 22 members**: Onboarding, infrastructure, data pipeline (equal distribution)

**Week 2: Parallel Development**
- **RAG Heat Team (10 people)**: 100% on RAG Heat MVP
  - 3 Backend, 2 AI/ML, 2 Data, 2 Frontend, 1 QA
- **SWARMCARE Team (8 people)**: 100% on SWARMCARE MVP
  - 4 Backend, 2 AI/ML, 1 Frontend, 1 QA

## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Top 10 Success Factors (Must-Haves for 30-Day Success)

1. **Team Commitment**: All 22 members commit to 10-12 hour days (60-70 hour weeks) for 30 days
2. **No Scope Creep**: Ruthless prioritization - MVP features only, defer everything else
3. **Parallel Execution**: RAG Heat and SWARMCARE developed in parallel (Week 2)
4. **Early Data Pipeline**: Neo4j ontologies loaded by Day 3-5 (critical path)
5. **Fast Decision-Making**: Project Director makes quick decisions, no committee debates
6. **Doctor + Lawyer Early**: Onboard doctor and lawyer by Week 2 (validation in Week 3)
7. **Daily Communication**: 15-min daily standups, no long meetings (maximize coding time)
8. **Technical Debt Acceptable**: Focus on working MVP, refactor later (Month 2)
9. **Demo-Driven**: Everything optimized for Day 29-30 demo (demo success = project success)
10. **Team Morale**: Celebrate small wins, mandatory rest on Sundays, team bonding

---

### Risk Mitigation (30-Day Specific Risks)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Neo4j ontology loading delays** | High | Critical | Start Day 1, assign 2 data engineers full-time, external consultant if needed |
| **Team burnout (60-70 hour weeks)** | High | High | Mandatory Sundays off, celebrate wins, pizza/snacks, team bonding |
| **SWARMCARE complexity (agents hard to build)** | Medium | High | Start AutoGen prototyping early (Day 2-3), simplify to 5 agents (not 7), external consultant |
| **Doctor validation failures** | Medium | Critical | Doctor involved from Day 15 (not Day 25), allow 1 week for feedback incorporation |
| **Jaideep not available Day 29-30** | Low | High | Flexible demo scheduling (Day 29-32), backup: record demo and send |
| **Production deployment issues** | Medium | Medium | Deploy to staging Day 22, test thoroughly, production deployment Day 24 (5-day buffer before demo) |

## 📋 DAILY STANDUP FORMAT (15 Minutes, Every Morning)

**Time**: 9:00-9:15 AM (sharp, no exceptions)

**Format** (each person <1 min):
1. **Yesterday**: What did I accomplish?
2. **Today**: What am I working on?
3. **Blockers**: Any blockers? (If yes, discuss offline after standup)

**Standup Rules**:
- **Timeboxed**: 15 min max (use timer)
- **Standing**: Everyone stands (keeps energy high, meeting short)
- **No deep discussions**: Blockers noted, discussed offline (parking lot)
- **Video on**: Everyone camera on (remote team engagement)

**Post-Standup** (9:15-9:30 AM, optional):
- **Parking lot discussions**: Resolve blockers (only affected people stay)
- **Daily plan alignment**: Tech Leads align on daily priorities

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES FOR 30-DAY SPRINT

### Time Management

1. **Timeboxing**: Every task has a time limit (2-4 hours max per task)
2. **No Perfectionism**: Done is better than perfect (MVP mindset)
3. **80/20 Rule**: Focus on 20% of features that deliver 80% of value
4. **Daily Progress**: Every day, ship something (code, feature, documentation)
5. **No Long Meetings**: Standups 15 min, other meetings <1 hour

### Team Collaboration

1. **Pair Programming**: For complex tasks (2 brains better than 1, faster debugging)
2. **Async Communication**: Use Slack for non-urgent (respect focus time)
3. **Quick Decisions**: Project Director decides quickly (no endless debates)
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Daily shoutouts in Slack, weekly recognition
5. **Help Each Other**: If someone is blocked, drop everything and help (we succeed as a team)

### Technical Practices

1. **Ship Often**: Deploy to dev environment multiple times/day (CI/CD)
2. **Test Early**: Write tests alongside code (not at the end)
3. **Code Reviews**: Fast reviews (<2 hours), focus on critical issues only
4. **Technical Debt**: Track it, but defer non-critical refactoring to Month 2
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring early (Day 22), catch issues before demo

### Morale & Well-being

1. **Mandatory Sundays Off**: No work on Sundays (rest is productivity)
2. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Pizza on Friday, shoutouts, virtual high-fives
3. **Transparency**: Share progress daily (everyone knows where we stand)
4. **Recognize Burnout**: If someone is struggling, lighten their load (team health > individual output)
5. **End Celebration**: Big celebration on Day 30 (we did something amazing!)
